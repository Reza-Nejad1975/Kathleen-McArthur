                    <p class="Heading1"><span class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur wrote many newspaper  articles and letters to the editor to alert others to environmental concerns,  as well as to broaden people&rsquo;s knowledge about the natural environment. She was  intensely interested in history and culture as a context for attitudes to the  natural world, and this is often evident in her writings. One strong influence  was her friendship with one of Australia&rsquo;s eminent poets and fellow WPSQ  founder, Judith Wright. Both women sought to change cultural attitudes so that  Australians would better know and love their landscape and wildlife.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> The  power of education through knowledge was very important to Kathleen. In a <em>Wildlife and Landscape</em> article in 1963  she noted that the good example set by well-informed children on an excursion  to look at Christmas Bells caused one adult in the group to remark that &lsquo;seeing  all of those children romping through the bush and over the plains without  picking any flowers had made her feel ashamed of her plan [to pick a bunch of  Christmas Bells]&rsquo;.</p>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">EDUCATING THE CHILDREN&hellip;</h1>
<p class="TextStandard">Many people tell me they have never  seen Christm<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Educating_the_children.jpg" width="250" height="312" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />as Bells growing in profusion. This is hardly surprising, for  wherever they are found, they are picked, and so it is only the first comers  who see them. These are amongst our most popular wildflowers and people cannot  resist them, whether it means tramping through pademelon swamps to pick them,  in defiance of the law, or buying them from vendors. The gratitude of all  patriots will go out to the first person in Queensland to cultivate this flower  commercially. He will find an eager market.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Some of us know  where the Bells grow in profusion, but to give publicity to such areas is to  destroy what we are working for&mdash;their preservation.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It was to such an area that recently a  large, organised party went. It comprised five families, including twelve  children and two extra adults, one of which was myself. Before setting out, one  woman said to me challengingly, &lsquo;and I am going to pick a bunch of bells&rsquo;. But  at the end of the day, after we had seen thousands of Christmas Bells, in some  places making a brilliant display she has not picked one flower. By way of  explanation she told me that seeing all those children romping through the bush  and over the plains without picking any flowers had made her feel ashamed of  her plan. Under the circumstances her bravado collapsed.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The children who set such a good  example were very normal kids ranging from five to fifteen years, but they had  the advantage of being members of the families of keen conservationists. The  eldest, a boy of fifteen, after years of accompanying his father on wildflower  outings already knows more south-east Queensland ground orchids than I do.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It has been found that the most enthusiastic  students of nature are children between ten and thirteen years. This fact  contains, in part, the answer to one of our greatest social problems and it  behoves parents to encourage any sign of such interest in their children. The  boy or girl who will spend all spare time in bird-watching or wildflowering,  collecting butterflies or studying insects is developing a lifetime interest  that is both healthy and happy and very likely to keep him or her away from  social disaster.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">For a parent of such children, or  uncle, aunt, godparent or interested friend, there is a way to practical help  for our young in giving those Christmas presents such as books on birds and  wildflowers, insects, animals, fish, trees or shells, to stimulate their  natural curiosity. In such fields of study there are numerous books that can be  used effectively, especially during the school holidays when time and  circumstances permit of exploration in the field.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In today&rsquo;s &lsquo;rat race&rsquo; we need to  educate a percentage of young people to a love of our indigenous flora and  fauna, so they in turn will fight to hand on to their &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;s people  something that is truly Australian.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">List of recommended books: <em class="Italic12">What Bird is That?</em> by Cayley; <em class="Italic12">An Australian Bird Book</em> by Leach; <em class="Italic12">Bird Wonders of Australia</em> by Chisholm; <em>Wildflowers of Australia</em> by Harris; <span class="Italic12"><em>Queensland Wildflowers</em></span><em>, a Selection</em> by  McArthur; <em>Australian Sea Shores</em> by  Dakin; <em>Australian Shells</em> by Allan; <em>Furred Animals of Australia</em> by  Troughton; <em class="Italic12">Reptiles of Australia</em> by  Worrell; <em class="Italic12">Australian Spiders</em> by  McKeown; Jacaranda Press Pocket Guides.</p>

<p class="TextStandard">One of the primary aims of the Wildlife  Preservation So<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Natural_history_competition.jpg" width="257" height="545" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ciety of Queensland is education to increase the knowledge of  Australian wildlife, especially amongst young people. Because there is no  branch of The Gould League in Queensland this factor of our education has been,  and still is being, neglected.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">This Society publishes the magazine &lsquo;Wildlife in Australia&rsquo;, all issues  of which are given for free to all primary schools in Queensland&ndash;&ndash;a most  generous gesture by the Jacaranda Press of Brisbane. Many schools subscribe to  &lsquo;Wildlife&rsquo; from their own funds because, quite understandably, one copy is not  enough for a large school, where interest runs high.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">To promote a stronger interest in and  study of our wildlife the Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society  of Queensland is announcing (see advertisement in this paper) a natural history  competition for Queensland school children. It will close on 31 March 1965, thus  giving all juniors many months, including the long summer vacation, in which to  work on their chosen projects. Experts in each field will be enlisted to judge  the work submitted, which may be chosen from any field of natural history. We  advise that individual work will gain more merit than secondhand material taken  from books. However as reference books are an essential requisite for study,  should they not be available locally we suggest application be made to the  Country Extension Section of the Public Library, in William Street, Brisbane.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The whole aim of this competition is to  increase the knowledge we have of our Australian flora and fauna and the land  and sea that support it. We want our young people to go out with their eyes  open and observe, then return home and compare their observations with the  observations of others that have been collected and published. We hope they  will make notes and sketches in the field for this is the best way of  remembering what they see.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Any future competitions will depend on  the success of this one, so we hope all our readers will tell as many juniors  as possible about this interesting competition and its excellent prizes.</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading1">THE WAY  AHEAD</h3>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The talks on <a href="../../../Photos/Slide Shows/Birds of the Sunshine Coast/index.html" target="_blank">birds</a> and <a href="../../../Photos/Slide Shows/Wildflowers of the Wallum Landscape/index.html" target="_blank">wildflowers</a> arranged for the August school  holidays by the Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society of  Queensland proved most popular. The Wildflower Room at Midyim, Kings Beach,  where they were given, was filled to capacity on four occasions. Of the 200 who  attended, approximately half were children, which was most encouraging to the  organisers. Without the interest of the adults, the children could not have  been present.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Also in the audiences was a small  percentage of school teachers. Next year, an entirely new syllabus on natural  science teaching will be introduced in Queensland Primary Schools. It contains  a new concept for teaching in Queensland for it is aimed not at the teaching of  a lot of facts, but to instill in young children an interest in the world  around them; an appreciation of their own local wildlife and landscape. The  benefits to be gained from this new syllabus will be quite dependant on the  sympathy, understanding and broad knowledge of the teachers. We feel that the  teachers who attended these talks would have gained much assistance from them.  Because of the neglect of this subject in the past, very few of our teachers  are competent to lead their pupils. The sins of our fathers! (Sins of  omission.)</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Normally, the knowledge we acquire may  be found in a reference library, but not only are such libraries inadequate in  this district, but works of reference for Queensland natural history are  extremely few.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">We cannot escape the fact that interest  in our State wildlife and landscape has been inexcusably neglected. The  introduction of a syllabus for which little teacher preparation has been made  will be slow in being effective. This is a time when the individual who has  concerned himself with these matters is going to be invaluable to society. Some  schools, such as Kenilworth, as a precious model, will get off to a good start  because individual teachers, past and present, have used the very methods  suggested by the new syllabus.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The primary aim of the Wildlife  Preservation Society of Queensland is education. In the study of our local  flora and fauna, the Caloundra Branch can provide a lead for both teachers and  students. We already have a good collection of colour slides of natural history  subjects to which we are adding continually. We have competent lecturers and we  offer a free service of inestimable value to the community.</p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>THE  POETRY OF OUR LANDSCAPE</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When the children of Kenilworth High  School learnt that I was a close friend of our Queensland poet Judith Wright,  they were eager for news of her. What had impressed them most were the facts  that a poet whose works they had to study was  (a) alive, (b) living in their own State of Queensland and (c) interested in  the same things such as farming and wildlife.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">For how many of us is poetry associated  with past centuries, when the language was expressed differently, and distant  landscapes so ordered and gentle, where brooks &lsquo;trickled&rsquo; through &lsquo;fields&rsquo; of  &lsquo;daffa-down-dilly&rsquo;, all of which is too hard to  envisage after growing-up with &lsquo;gullies&rsquo; in the &lsquo;paddocks&rsquo; where you watch your  step for snakes in the &lsquo;blady grass&rsquo;?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">That most of us cannot find poetry in  our daily lives is the fault of our education, which in the past was seldom  slanted with Australian sentiment. Our educators were the graduates of a cultural  system related to which this was a new, strange land with landscape in  different colours and forms and wildflowers and animals for which they had no  names, all so vast and varied that one could never get to know it in a  lifetime, and so they turned back nostalgically to the study of Latin and Greek  and the cultivation of roses.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The sympathetic writers who saw beauty  in Queensland wildflowers, such as the explorers Mitchell, Cunningham and  Leichhardt, have been neglected. Over and over again we are served up Burke and  Wills&ndash;&ndash;the story of men who were so insensitive to this country they preferred  to die rather than to try to understand it.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When we do eventually turn to seeing  our country through the succession of writers from Captain Cook to Judith Wright  we will be laying the foundation of an indigenous culture. And when we do this  we will turn to our landscapes to see for the first time a heritage of interest  and beauty. Will it be still there? </p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">There is no doubt that we value our  uncleared land by the price of the mill timber. Our rain forests are beautiful  at hundreds of dollars an acre plus so many super feet of cabinet woods. Who  wants Scribbly Gum?

                    <p class="TextStandard">Where the honey flow is strong in  winter and the apiarists deposit their bee hives for the cold months; where the  flocks of birds from the South find refuge and food and give in return their  song, their colour and their insect-eating services; where tourists would love  to be shown a landscape where bloom and birds sing in winter&ndash;&ndash;can we find  beauty? Is such country rubbish, ugly and useless and progress made only  through destroying it?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There are many people who find beauty  in a winter landscape full of flowers and bird song. There is a honey industry  that can expand on it. Not only farmers, who stand to gain most, but all of us  owe much to the birds that control our insect pests. When we have exterminated  our wallum vegetation and deprived the birds of their food, shelter and nesting  sites and they come to us no more we may begin to realise the benefit to man of  other life forms. For students they will be: &lsquo;Birds long vanished with the  fallen forest&ndash;&ndash;described in copperplate on unread pages&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Conservation of our wildlife is not  only the concern of the wildflower and birdwatcher; it is a necessary  foundation for the building of a national culture.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A new era begins this year with the  introduction of the revised syllabus for national history in primary and  secondary schools. Many new schools have been built in this district in the  past few years in which these subjects will be taught, but along with the  erection of these fine buildings, the surrounding land was cleared of native  vegetation thus destroying the very material set for study. The time has come  to look with fresh vision on unspoilt areas of bushland close to schools  whether they be &lsquo;useless&rsquo; scribbly gum forests, paperbark swamps or other  vegetation types, for their value to academic and scientific education is  inestimable. Very few schools, like Kenilworth, have had the farsightedness to  plant up their grounds with a wide variety of native trees and shrubs.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Getting something from our landscape is  the other half of giving it study and understanding. Giving to our students  some unspoilt countryside will allow them to get the knowledge and love they  need for their national culture. If we allow it all to go and live surrounded  only by crops, weeds and insect pests on to which we continually spray poisons  we will be raising our future generations on hatred of other life forms and the  daily practice of death and destruction. How much happier would life be could  we teach our children to know and love</p>
