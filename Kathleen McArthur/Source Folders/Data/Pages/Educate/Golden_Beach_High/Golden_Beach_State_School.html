<p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur was invited to  identify plants in the school grounds and from there grew a love of working  with this school&rsquo;s children and staff. One of her books&ndash;&ndash;<em>The Little Fishes of Pumicestone Passage</em>&ndash;&ndash;was inspired by the close  ties she developed, and by a desire to reach out to a young audience.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">To this day Golden Beach State School  honours her memory with the Kathleen McArthur Wallum Habitat and other gardens  within the school grounds.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
                    <h1 class="Heading1"><span class="TextStandard"><img src="../../../Photos/Gardening_at_Golden_Beach.jpg" alt="Groundsman Lloyd Clarke" width="250" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" />In late 1982, as Golden Beach State School  buildings neared completion, a bulldozer arrived to clear wallum heathland for  play areas. Principal Len Fox successfully negotiated the retention of large  patches of natural vegetation. The school opened the following year, and after  expressing initial concern about the aesthetic value of these native plants the  school community was delighted by abundant and widely varied flowerings in late  winter.</span></h1>
<p class="TextStandard">Unfortunately no-one associated with the  school knew much about this flora, and Caloundra conservationist and botanical  artist Kathleen McArthur was invited to identify plants and talk about their  characteristics to teachers and students. She, too, was delighted to see a  wealth of <em>Aotus</em>, Wedding Bush, <em>Dillwynia</em>, <em>Boronia</em> and, of course, <em>Banksia  aemula</em>, which was adopted as the school emblem. Kathleen was equally  pleased to find <img src="../../../Photos/Kathleen_with_Year7_students.jpg" alt="Kathleen talks to Year 7 studenta about the abundant Leptospermum" width="250" height="156" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />numerous rare species, and saw the promotion of the school  gardens as an opportunity to preserve a wallum habitat and educate the  community.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1985 Year 7 students began researching  the school&rsquo;s flora. Kathleen and Ken Whittaker assisted staff develop a nature  trail through the wallum, where over fifty plants were identified. An album  with information and photographs was prepared for student and community  reference.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Through her work with children in Years 6  and 7, Kathleen decided to launch her latest book with their help. On 25 July  1985 around sixty students performed songs and sat on the stage at the CCSA  Hall for the official launch of <img src="../../../Photos/Golden_Beach_Research_Booklet.jpg" alt="Year 7 students present the first Research Boolet to Principle Merv Paddison" width="250" height="179" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" /><em>Little  Fishes of Pumicestone Passage</em>. This cemented Kathleen&rsquo;s association with  the school, and celebrated her huge contribution to community knowledge about  the local environment and her galvanising of positive attitudes towards local plant  species.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">For many years Year 6 and 7 students guided  visitors to the school along the native plant trails. Kathleen continued to  visit the school and work with students and teachers as interest in this  wonderful natural resource grew. The parent body spent many hours improving  walkways through the heath, delineating boundaries with logs to protect the  plants.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There was excitement at the discovery of a  rare plant species, <em>Acacia attenuata</em>,  on a tract of wallum on the school&rsquo;s southern boundary purchased in 1995.  Community interest grew with this additional attraction, and it was doubly  fitting that the new area was officially named the Kathleen McArthur Wallum  Habitat on World Environment Day, on 5 June 2001. Two pupils identified from a  photograph of the launch of <em>Little Fishes  of Pumicestone Passage</em>&ndash;&ndash;and now young mothers&ndash;&ndash;were invited to attend the  dedication ceremony, symbolising an enduring community interest in the local  environment triggered by Kathleen&rsquo;s association with the school.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><img src="../../../Photos/Kathleen_presents_Little_Fishes.jpg" alt="Kathleen presents Little Fishes" width="228" height="320" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />The last twenty years has strengthened  community focus on Golden Beach State School&rsquo;s bushland. In 1998 Ann Moran  completed a comprehensive list of plants, which confirmed the depth and  accuracy of Kathleen&rsquo;s botanical knowledge. John Eley, Kay Dann, John O&rsquo;Connor and  Noreen Prendergast initiated numerous projects and dedicated gardens.  Environmental organisations, the local Council and developers provided support,  helping to direct the focus on building a rich school environment into the 21st  century.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">With an enduring community interest in the  Kathleen McArthur Wallum Habitat and gardens, these special areas of Golden  Beach State School are assured of careful preservation, along with the memories  of a wonderful environmental pioneer&ndash;&ndash;Kathleen McArthur.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">By Leanne Edmistone</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A native wallum habitat has been named  after well-known environmentalist Kathleen McArthur for her contribution to  environmental studies at Golden Beach State School.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A special parade was held on world  Environment Day yesterday, to dedicate the original, undisturbed pocket of  wallum marsh in the school grounds to Ms McArthur, who<img src="../../../Photos/Golden_Beach_High_School_Sign.jpg" alt="Golden Beach State School Wallum Habitat" width="300" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" /> recently passed away.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Principal Dennis Downs said Ms McArthur  played a key role in developing the school&rsquo;s environmental program, helping to  identify native and endangered species and establish native reserves in the  school grounds. Mr Downs said environmental issues were a major part of the  school&rsquo;s curriculum, with all students currently participating in about ten  projects, including a butterfly habitat and frog breeding area.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;We have a focus on environmental  education, because we consider it so important and we have had a major  opportunity to preserve a few areas in their natural form as well as planting  other gardens,&rsquo; he said.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Guests at the parade included Wildlife  Preservation Society president Arnim Scheer, Ms McArthur&rsquo;s sister Judy  Nelson-Gracie, WPS member Isabel Jordan, local councillor Chris White and Bilai  Education Centre principal Allan Egan.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As well as erecting a large sign, each  class planted a native tree as a border around the special area, which also  contains a rare and endangered species of wattle.</p>
