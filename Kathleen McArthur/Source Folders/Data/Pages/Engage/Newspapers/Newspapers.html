For many years these articles  were a &lsquo;voice of conservation&ndash;education&ndash;research&rsquo; in Sunshine Coast newspapers,  which Kathleen hoped would both &lsquo;entertain and instruct&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p class="TextStandard">For <em class="Italic12">Wildlife  and Landscape</em> from 1973 to 1975 Kathleen wrote <em class="Italic12">Birds of the Sunshine Coast, </em>a series of 122 articles published in  the <em class="Italic12">Sunshine Coast Weekly Advertiser</em>.

<p class="Heading1"><strong>PROGRESS</strong>!</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Man inherits the earth. When a man inherits a fortu<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Progress.jpg" width="249" height="527" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ne, if he squanders  it in his lifetime, leaving nothing for his sons, he is condemned by his fellow  men. Yet, when man squanders his inheritance of natural resources, those who  condemn&ndash;&ndash;the conservationists&ndash;&ndash;are accused of trying to impede progress.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When a man inherits a fortune and uses  it for the benefit not only of himself and his fellow men, but also for his  sons and for their sons, he is a good man.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The country we inherit, the national  heritage is not ours, but is the lifeblood of all men, alive and yet to be  born. We have no right to take what we desire from it without provision for the  future.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In Australia there are mainly moral issues,  for with few exceptions the rape of the land is not legally a crime. Things are  different in some countries where legislation can deprive a man of his land for  bad practice.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is not progress to destroy however  great the immediate gain may be. Ancient history tells us of lands flowing with  milk and honey, which today are barren wastes. Deserts have been created in the  lifetime of living men. Between the extremes of well-managed, productive  country and the desert wastes there are many stages of fertility destruction.  Three generations of farming in this district have reduced some fertile forest  land to a stage of uneconomical use. Much of this destruction was done in the  name of progress.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There is talk nowadays of draining the  tidal swamps of Moreton Bay to eliminate the breeding grounds of some species  of mosquitoes. By doing this in the United States of America large shellfish  industries were destroyed, for it is the tidal marshes that are the breeding  grounds of shellfish. Shellfish, a most valuable food, is produced without cost  and needs only to be harvested. Tidal wetlands are also the breeding grounds of  game birds&ndash;&ndash;another free food, as well as the basis of the industry involved in  supplying the hunter with his expensive equipment. As well as game birds, the  marshes are the breeding grounds of some of agriculture&rsquo;s unpaid work force,  the pest destroying birds such as the Ibis.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Before we insist that the reclamation of swamps is progress, all facts  should be considered. There should be a central authority backed by scientific  research to supply information on the values and dangers of using and abusing  our natural resources. This would indeed be progress!</p>

                    <strong>SCORCHED EARTH POLICY OF  CALOUNDRA</strong>
                    <p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&hellip;Five years ago, before coming here, I asked a fr<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Scorched_Earth.jpg" width="230" height="495" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />iend in  Brisbane what Caloundra was like. He said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, spoilt by  man&rsquo;.</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">Nobody could deny Caloundra its claim to beauty, but it  grows noticeably less so with each day, with the criminal destruction of its  native trees, shrubs and wildflowers.</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">At present it appears to have reached an all time low with  the bareness of King&rsquo;s Beach, the burning of the Headland, the appalling  desert-like entry along the road into Caloundra, and the unnecessary clearing  of treed blocks of land throughout this once lovely area.</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">Many hundreds of visitors have commented to me on  Caloundra&rsquo;s lack of trees. What are we doing about it? Trees that have taken  years to reach maturity and provided a natural and pleasing setting are cut  down and later have to be replaced at considerable expense and trouble.</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">It&rsquo;s hard work clearing these trees; it&rsquo;s hard work planting  more trees that may not thrive in sandy soil and salt-laden wind. The most  sought after houses are those where the home-builder has used the natural  setting and kept the trees.</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">The wildflowers of this district are becoming very scarce.  When we are fortunate enough to have some on our property why not leave them  undisturbed?</span></em><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">We could make Caloundra a place noted for its natural  beauty. We have surf, sun and sand. Couldn&rsquo;t we concentrate on restoring this  lovely place to its right to be called&ndash;&ndash;Caloundra, Beautiful Headland?</span></em> </p>
<p class="TextStandard">The above is a letter received this  week. It is a cry of pain, which we can perfectly understand.</p>
<p class="TextStandard">At last year&rsquo;s Australasian Tourist  Conference in Noosa, the New Zealand representative stressed the fact that we  were, in trying to develop a tourist trade, in danger of destroying the very  thing that would bring tourists&ndash;&ndash;the naturally distinctive features of our  landscape. He told me that huge bowls of Christmas flowers decorated his hotel,  but he would have preferred to see them growing: where did they grow? Were  there no facilities for taking tourists to see such a sight, and much more.</p>
<p class="TextStandard">After all the delegates had left the  conference the New Zealander took an extra day to see the trees and wildflowers  of the Noosa area. A tour was arranged for him privately. It had to be  arranged, for as we all know, we do not feature such programmes for tourists.</p>
<p class="TextStandard">At a recent National Parks Seminar in  Cunningham&rsquo;s Gap National Park, to which came representatives from southern  States, a speaker mentioned that there were wildflower reserves in Caloundra,  but when he was seeking them and made enquiries at several places in the town  no one could direct him to them. It appears to such people that we are very  backward at promoting the very things that interest our visitors. And it is  true!</p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>WILDFLOWER  TIME AGAIN!</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is a happy coincidence that the  school holidays occur at a time when the Sunshine Coast wildflowers are  blooming well. In addition to making a fine show, there is a wide variety of  species to be found.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Well in bloom at the present time are a  number of our most pl<img src="../../../Photos/Diuris_punetata_White_doubletails.jpg" alt="Diuris punetata White doubletails" width="300" height="424" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />easing ground orchids. Both the Yellow and the White  Doubletails may be seen from Dicky Beach to Currimundi as well as other similar  areas all along the coastline. Each resort has still some wildflower plain left  nearby. There are masses of Pinkies, Bluies and Whities as the children call  the pink and the white <em>Caladenias</em> and  the blue Waxlips. They are all five-fingered small orchids and can be seen to  advantage where the Wallum has been mowed to the south of Currimundi Lake. For  the keen eye there are the less pretty but fascinatingly shaped Beak Orchids  and Leek Orchids. A lucky person may even find a rare Horned Orchid or the  Burnt Orchid which is less rare but harder to find, although this last may have  finished its flowering by the time this is printed. The beautiful blue Sun  Orchids, one of the loveliest of all Australian wildflowers, will be in bloom;  on the warm days opened out to reveal its full loveliness, but on cold days it  will stay closed.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Vanilla Lilies or Chocolate Tops, the  blooms of those mauve-green reed-like plants with clustered heads of mauve are  coming out nicely. These are usually seen to advantage each Spring by the  Beerwah Forest, but not this year as the patch was recently thoughtlessly (?)  ploughed up.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">On some days our Wild Irises will be  seen in large numbers and on other days there will be only a few. Just why this  is so still remains a mystery. When these three-petalled blooms are out they  add a dominant purple tinge to the landscape.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is early yet for a good showing of  Wallum <em>Boronia</em> but some can be found.  Possumflower, our other <em>Boronia</em> is  flowering well. In some parts of the Sunshine Coast a third <em>Boronia</em> may be found&ndash;&ndash;<em>Boronia polygalifolia</em>, a small pale,  although delicately tinted flower it is. Just to the north of us, in the  Cooloola area and on Fraser Island there is the rare and lovely <em>Boronia rivularis</em>.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Many are the wildflowers which can be  discovered, with yellow peas predominant. Wedding Bush is past its best, but  still worth admiring. Common Heath is good on the swampier places with only a  small amount of Coral Heath. Some Banksias of all species will be blooming on  and our common Lamb&rsquo;s Tail Wattle is conveniently late this year.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is hoped that many people of all  ages will find enjoyment in wandering among our fine wildflowers&ndash;&ndash;enjoying  them, yet leaving them to be seen by those who will follow. Many tours are  arranged for the months ahead, bringing bus loads of people from afar. These  will include members of Garden Clubs, naturalists, Guide and Brownie packs and  others. If everyone is prepared to enjoy the flowers of our wild public gardens  without wanting to pluck large bunches or even small select posies, then on the  whole the pleasure of it all will be shared by the greatest number of people to  whom they belong. The picking of wildflowers in populated areas is no longer  one of the human rights.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">For those wishing to know more about  our local wildflowers there will be lectures with slides on Tuesdays 16th and  23rd August in the Wildflower Room, Midyim, 16 Orvieto Terrace, King&rsquo;s Beach,  Caloundra, 3.30 pm to 5 pm. Lectures on our birds will be given by Robin Elks  at the same time and address, on Mondays 15th and 22nd. These will be free and  all are welcome to come!</p>

<p class="TextStandard">The remark by Councillor Peirce at the  Landsborough Shire Council meeting as quoted on the front page of your issue of  August 25th, suggesting that the Sunshine Festival Committee &lsquo;should go out in  the bush and collect palms like old times,&rsquo; is an example of past mistakes not  having been corrected.

                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1962 the Wildlife Preservation Society of  Queensland was established to publish a natural history magazine to encourage  an interest in our indigenous wildlife. The idea was initiated by David Fleay,  who was made well aware in the management of his wildlife sanctuary how little  was known of our natural history.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">My time had been devoted to the  promotion of our wildflowers, both in black and white and in watercolours; it  was now time to add the story of the area&rsquo;s splendid fauna.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Sometimes in company but mostly alone I  covered the area from the coast to the Blackall range, west to Kenilworth,  north to Noosa and the wonderful Cooloola. It took three years of looking,  listening, listing and learning before I felt entitled to go public.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Wednesday May 16, 1973 Birds of the  Sunshine Coast was introduced in the <em>Sunshine  Coast Weekly</em> with my thoughts at the time, and the Breedens&rsquo; photograph of  the White-eyed Duck. At that time, mid-Seventies, it was a strange fact, yet a  fact nevertheless, that comparatively few Queenslanders took a keen interest in  their birds. This was most noticeable when reading the newsletters and  magazines of the Queensland Ornithological Society, where the majority of the  names of those who contributed and those who attended meetings and field  outings were people from overseas or interstate. Englishmen, Canadians, New  Zealanders, visiting American and Japanese with other-staters dominated the lists  and did the work necessary to keep the Society alive.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">I well recall how birds became a  controversial item at the hearing of t<img src="../../../Photos/Callistemon_and_Scarlet_Honeyeater.jpg" alt="Callistemon and Scarlet Honeyeater" width="300" height="333" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />he Cooloola mining applications in the  Gympie Mining Warden&rsquo;s Court. The Mining Company&rsquo;s Counsel, when cross  examining me, tried to belittle my knowledge of the birds of the area, yet as I  drove to Gympie each day I could see the flocks of migrating Honey-eaters  moving on the coast towards Cooloola for the beginning of the wallum winter  honey-flow. No one else in the court seemed to have any knowledge of birds so I  was able to get some silent laughter when the QC for the miners questioned a  fellow conservationist with the question: &lsquo;Do you know what a dabchick is?&rsquo; The  erroneous reply given was &lsquo;Yes! a Swamphen&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">One company manager, giving his  evidence, said there were no birds in the area under application for he had  covered that country more than anyone else and the only bird he had seen was  one lonely emu. There were, he said, more birds in the mined area at Inskip  PoInt than in the whole of the Cooloola area. It could be seen what he meant,  as people can recognise the birds of human habitation&ndash;&ndash;the Peewees, Magpies,  Kookaburras, Willie Wagtails, Butcherbirds and Crows, but they know no others  and although approximately 200 plus species of birds have been recorded for the  Cooloola area, few would recognise or know by call the majority of them.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The avifauna of Queensland is rich, but  gets poorer every year&ndash;&ndash;let&rsquo;s say every month these last few years as habitat  is being rapidly destroyed. There would be much more hue and cry from  Queenslanders against habitat destruction if more of them took an interest in  the local birds.</p>
                    <span class="TextStandard"> Back  in the Seventies I was asked to contribute lists of birds and where to find  them for Cooloola and Caloundra for a series of birdwatching guides being  prepared for publication. With co-operation from various people I submitted a  list for Cooloola, but refused to do the same for Caloundra with the comment  that it was anyone&rsquo;s guess what birds would be seen in Caloundra in the future.  [The same could be said of the following areas:] The north bank of Bells Creek  where 65 species could be recorded in an hour, after the tide-banks were  disturbed and the bushland cleared; the mouth of the Mooloolah River where Northern  Hemisphere waders rested, [that] became canal estates; more recently Lamerough  mangroves&ndash;&ndash;the last of their kind for special species&ndash;&ndash;clear felled. We the  people tried to save it all, even taking the Council to court. But it is no use  weeping for the lost past.</span>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">THE JABIRU<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p class="TextStandard">It was on 11th April (dates are most  important in bird studies) when we were watching waders at the mouth of Bell&rsquo;s  Creek that a Jabiru arrived on the flat and proceeded to walk right into the  binoculars. It was a wonderful piece of luck, for this noble bird was showing  off what must surely be his breeding plumage.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cayley, in <em>What bird is that</em>, tells us the Jabiru&rsquo;s breeding season is &lsquo;May to  October, but at any time after heavy rain&rsquo;, which establishes a reasonable  excuse for this bird to be wearing his best clothes.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The first change to be noticed was in  the colour of his neck, which instead of being dull black was a bright luminous  green. The top of his head was a rich red surrounded by an aura of blue. These  two colours blending together gave to the head a purplish look. The legs were a  vivid, deep pink. The illustration of this bird in Cayley&rsquo;s book shows blue and  green in the wings. Although we were able to see the bird very clearly there  was no apparent colour at all in the black section of its wings.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Watching it feed, it appeared to poke  its slightly open bill in to the mud or sand again and again, only sometimes  bringing out small fish which needed juggling about to get into a position for  swallowing. Now and then when stalking along in water it would flap its huge  wings, which, I have been told, is to drive fish into a suitable position for  catching. However, each time this was performed no fish were caught.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">At last, after feeding with little  result on this particular bank, it flew off northward up the Passage and was  later seen on the flat at the mouth of Lamerough Creek.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><img src="../../../Photos/Jabiru.jpg" alt="Jabiru" width="202" height="315" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />After writing of the Jabiru in an  earlier article I met Mr. J. Murphy of Bulcock Street, Caloundra, who has lived  in Caloundra for twenty-six years and earlier still was well acquainted with  the river flats of this district where Jabiru feed. He told me that he had  heard the booming call of Jabiru&ndash;&ndash;a very rare experience for they are seldom  heard, so seldom in fact that some people think them mute. He imitated the call  after saying how he first heard it as a young man when fishing at midnight in  the lower reaches of the Caboolture River.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mr. Murphy said he had never seen two  Jabiru together. Although they are usually solitary, I recently saw a pair just  south of Bell&rsquo;s Creek and a friend reported seeing five together in the Upper  Noosa River, where they are known to breed.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Occasionally, one may see this huge  bird (one of Australia&rsquo;s largest) sailing on the high winds overhead, catching  the sunlight in the white of its wings, its head and long neck and bill  stretched out before and its long legs trailing behind. It is an exciting  sight.</p>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">THE DRONGO IS A MOCKING BIRD<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Last year I wrote about the Spangled  Drongo, but at th<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Drongo.jpg" width="250" height="469" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />at time I did not know that this bird can be quite a clever  mimic.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Here I would  like to quote the famous Australian ornithologist A.H. Chisholm, who says,  &lsquo;What has to be realised is that there are many species of Australian birds,  widely varied in character, that practise vocal mimicry more or less freely,  and at least ten of these are highly competent mockers. In addition, several  species have been detected mimicking occasionally, in their reflective moments,  as it were, and others again will probably be revealed as mimics when they are  better known&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Birds well known as mimics are the  Olive-backed Oriole (which last year at Sandy Cape I heard imitating the calls  of numerous birds, interspersed with its own call), the Satin Bowerbird and  most famous of all, the two Lyrebirds. From my own observations I suspect the  Whipbird is another mimic, but as yet have only circumstantial evidence.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Nowhere in Australian bird books have I  read of the Drongo being a mimic, but in <em>Birds  of the World</em>, the author, Oliver L. Austin, in speaking of Drongos says, &lsquo;a  few mimic other species of birds with considerable skill&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">So I was not surprised one morning  recently when our Drongo, which spends the winter months here, sat calmly in a  tree outside the house and imitated the calls of the birds in the garden at  that time&ndash;&ndash;the Brown Honeyeater; that simple, sweet, out-of-season note of the  Rufous Whistler and the &lsquo;practise&rsquo; notes of the Magpie; all the while  pretending to be a honeyeater and pecking deep into the flower of a Paperbark.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When my sister, whose garden runs into  mine, reported that this bird was playing the role of both cat and scolding  bird, I treated her story with the usual bird observer&rsquo;s scepticism. I would  believe it when I heard it for myself! However, it was not many days later that  the performance was repeated for me just outside my kitchen window. I was able  to watch this bird as an actor taking two parts, both cat and bird.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">From John Orrell in Cairns, who writes  nature notes for <em>Wildlife</em>, the <em>Cairns Post </em>and <em>North Australian Monthly</em>, have come stories of Drongos taking the  nestlings of smaller birds. It is pleasing to report that Drongos on the  Sunshine Coast have sweeter tastes, sweeter songs and sweeter natures.</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading1">TO GO  OR TO STAY&hellip;</h3>
<p class="TextStandard">Whether to go or to stay&ndash;&ndash;that is the  question people on<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/To_go_or_stay.jpg" width="250" height="327" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" /> this Coast are asking themselves now.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The people who choose to live on the  Sunshine Coast because of its natural beauty, its unpretentiousness, good  fishing, clean beaches, its rural hinterland and last&ndash;&ndash;but not  least&ndash;&ndash;good-neighbourly people are seeing it all disappear before an  undesirable, artificial, materialistic replacement.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Instead of seascapes they look out at rows  of brick blocks that might have been designed as housing commission units in  Surry Hills or Footscray.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Quiet is gone. Semi-trailers laden with  bricks roar through the streets and work is allowed on building sites from  before 6 am to 10 pm, with no consideration for visitors on holiday. Residents  have learnt not to expect much.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">How much longer can we put up with it? Let&rsquo;s go and look at Cooran,  which doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been &lsquo;buggered up&rsquo; yet. And when you wake to the  wonderful dawn chorus of Brown Honeyeaters and White-cheeks in harmony with the  Mozartian call of Silvereyes only then do you realise that if you were to sell  out and have the garden bulldozed away and the whole covered in bricks and  concrete with, at the most, a few square metres of artificial landscaping,  there would be no habitat for birds, no birdsong at all, no birds&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Then you start listing the wildlife  that would be wiped out through our opting out. Apart from resident birds such  as the above, there are all the visiting birds and the autumn and spring  migrants, which take refuge on their way north and south. There are also the  nomads that come from the west when drought denies them a living there.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><em>Midyim</em> and <em>Sana</em> gardens support a family of  Ring-tailed Possums, which, unlike Brushtails, are herbivorous, living off the  tips of trees mostly. The grey-headed Fruit Bats would be denied their  midsummer feast of Bloodwood bloom, but they don&rsquo;t mind the alternative of  backyard pawpaw. Our Bearded Dragons and Pink-tongue Skinks would be the first  to go under the bulldozer, which would be just as well, as what creature would  want a diet of pinebark?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The guilt of responsibility for the  demise of so much life would be intolerable.</p>
