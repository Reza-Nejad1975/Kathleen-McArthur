                    <p class="TextStandard">1946 brought such peace&hellip;At last I met  Estelle Thomson whose family had a weekender on the headland and had published  a charming little wildflower book in 1929, with familiar local species in  water-colours and still available from Barker&rsquo;s bookstore. Why hadn&rsquo;t I seen  it? I was a Barker&rsquo;s customer!</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is a sad story and I feel for her  after all this time. She writes in her preface:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">This  small booklet is in no sense of the words a botanical textbook. It is issued by  one flower-lover in the hope that others similarly inclined may be glad to  recognize in it some familiar friends of bush and wayside. It is hoped that this  may be the first of a short series of similar booklets, and for this reason  many popular favourites have been held in reserve to appear at a later date.  When the series is complete the separate numbers might be bound together to  form a single volume.</p>
                    <span class="TextStandard"> But,  there yer go! She had organised wildflower shows in Brisbane, had written  articles accompanied by her pen and ink drawings for the <em>Courier</em>, always willing to promote our own floral wealth, so what  went wrong? It was the cursed myth&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;there are no wildflowers in Queensland&rsquo;.  You have to go to W. A., go to Kings Park; people had the propaganda off pat,  all unaware that King&rsquo;s Park had lost its display&ndash;&ndash;it takes more than a  P.A.R.K. to keep earth flowering. It was to be around the 1980s that it was  replanted for display. It was and still is a powerful myth.</span>

  &hellip;What I find most noticeable after fire  is the use of wildflowers in the balance of nature. It is the wildflower that  holds the sand dunes together; the wildflower that will germinate on eroded  land and the wildflower that will spring up through the ashes of a fire. It is  the wildflower, then, that nurses the soil in the first stages of its return to  health. And the importance of the flower is emphasised when the flower-bud is  known to open after fire as soon as the leaf-bud.</p>

There have been two of the  greatest teams of navigator, scientist and artist in all history, travelling  more than ten thousand miles of danger and hardship to work with great skill,  diligence and excitement, only for it all to be kept from the world and for no  good reason either.

<h3 class="Heading1">HOMEWORK  BEGAN HER PAINTING</h3>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Flowers and birds had never crossed the  mind of Mrs. Kathl<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Homework_began_her_painting.jpg" width="250" height="376" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />een McArthur until her daughter began to ask questions about  them for her schoolwork. To answer the questions she turned to books but found  there was little information available on the topic. It was a strange quirk of  fate which brought about Mrs. McArthur&rsquo;s interest in painting the flowers.  Following extra heavy rain along the Queensland coast several years ago her  house was marooned by floods. To pass away the time she picked up her  daughter&rsquo;s paint box and began to paint some of the flowers which were on the  table. &lsquo;I was so delighted with the result that I continued with the painting,&rsquo;  Mrs. McArthur told me yesterday. &lsquo;I gradually built up a collection of  paintings then studied all I could about flowers,&rsquo; Mrs. McArthur said. &lsquo;I found  that Queensland wildflowers in particular had not been written about although  flowers in other States had been well covered,&rsquo; she said.</p>
                    <p><span class="Text12Bold">Publishers</span><br />
                    <span class="TextStandard">Finally Mrs. McArthur had the idea of  producing a book on Queensland wildflowers and sent her paintings and a  manuscript to several publishers. &lsquo;The trouble was that they all said it would  be too expensive to produce the book in colour,&rsquo; Mrs. McArthur said. &lsquo;They all  agreed that if I would include flowers from other States they would be  interested but I wanted to promote Queensland flowers. &lsquo;I wanted to know just  how much it really would cost so I sent the whole lot to a publisher in Adelaide  and they told me it would cost between $40,000 and $60,000 to print. &lsquo;In the  end I decided to have some of my paintings printed for sale but these were  rather slow in selling.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">During this time Mrs. McArthur&rsquo;s  interest in flora and fauna had grown and she became an active founder member  of the Queensland Wildlife Preservation Society in Brisbane. She also turned  one of the rooms in her Caloundra home into a gallery where she exhibited her  paintings to the public, during the tourist season mainly. &lsquo;There was a lot of  interest at first, mainly from visitors but the local people weren&rsquo;t very  keen.&rsquo; Mrs. McArthur said. &lsquo;I found there was more interest shown about  Queensland flowers in Victoria than in Queensland. &lsquo;I had several exhibitions  of my paintings and then in 1959 I had my first book published. &lsquo;I want to do a  second book one day but I just haven&rsquo;t had time with all my other work in  recent years,&rsquo; she added regretfully</span>
<p><span class="Text12Bold">Local Flowers</span><br />
                      <span class="TextStandard">This is Mrs. McArthur&rsquo;s first break for  some time and she is taking the opportunity, while staying with friends, Mr.  and Mrs. Sam Carruthers, to paint some local flowers. Her time has been taken  up with preservation work of all types, mostly in and around the Caloundra  area. Among her activities she germinates trees specially suited to life on the  Coast, which is more rugged than the inland. All these are grown in her own  garden and this takes up a great deal of time. Apart from that she is secretary  of the Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mount  Isa will gain something from Mrs. McArthur&rsquo;s stay in the district. Mrs McArthur  has just completed a new plate of paintings, which are all flowers she has  picked in Mount Isa. This will be added to her collection for her second book  &lsquo;When I get the time to complete it,&rsquo; she said. She is also very excited about  a trip next week, which will take her to Gregory, Burketown, Normanton and  Karumba. She is going with Mr. And Mrs. Carruthers and hopes to find plenty of  wildflowers.</p>
                    <p><strong class="Text12Bold">Conservation</strong><br />
                      <span class="TextStandard">This morning Mrs. McArthur will talk at  the Marie Kruttschnitt Club, Hilton Hall, about wild flowers and conservation  of wild life. She will show the completed plate of Mount Isa flowers, and a  copy of her book, <em>Queensland Wild Flowers</em>,  will also be on show. Anyone interested in going along to the talk will be very  welcome as it is not only for members of the club.</span></p>

<p class="TextStandard">[After returning from Africa in late  1949]&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">Mt Mee had wildflowers; the hills were  forested. The only public building was the local hall and time was everywhere  just waiting to be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">It was there I taught myself to paint  wildflowers in watercolour, added to which, found in Thompson&rsquo;s Queen St.  Bookstore, <em>The Art of Botanical  Illustration</em> by the world authority Wilfred Blunt. The 1950s were set to be  a very special period of my life, so come along with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">Of first importance was to get my  general knowledge in order, next to paint towards improvement, do as many black  and white drawings for illustrating articles, gather popular names for the  flowers in people language while keeping the scientific classification in a  handy pocket, to use this precious TIME.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">Articles went off to the <em>Courier-Mail</em> and <em>Country Life</em>, which were accepted and I jumped at an offer to tell  stories on the ABC, stopping at three, as I really was not ready for that.  Publicity brought requests to speak to clubs and schools. The flower painting  needed constant work for improvement. Despite what was said earlier, specimens  were picked, as they needed to be pressed for sending to the Herbarium for  classification. Right from the word go I aimed to publish a wildflower book.  Testing work for appraisal, some plates were sent to an Adelaide publisher, the  response to which was anything but flattering, but that didn&rsquo;t worry me as they  were each only one flower whereas I had already become aware that wildflowers  were depicted in bunches, in the public taste, as were Gumtips with Jerberas,  whereas I was following my book on botanical art based on the British Museum of  Natural History, with some compromise. Work on the book was finished in 1959.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard"> <em class="Italic12">Queensland  Wildflowers&ndash;&ndash;A Selection</em> was taken direct to the Griffin Press,  ignoring the publishing houses, while the manager helped me to design it. The  first launching was in Melbourne where friends had arranged a showing in the  Joshua McClelland Print Room in Collins Street accompanied by press and  television interviews. In Brisbane Watty Thomson gave me a &lsquo;do&rsquo; in the gallery  of his Queen St. Bookstore covered by the <em>Courier-Mail</em> Arts reporter with about four lines. To see ourselves as others see us! In the  three-column-wide interview in the <em>Melbourne  Age</em> was this description of me: &lsquo;slightly built, grey haired woman with a  lively mind&rsquo;. Me! Not yet 45!</p>

<p class="TextStandard">[Looking back to the publication in  1959 of <em>Queensland wildflowers: A  selection</em> and subsequent promotion]&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">There is something about simple  wildflowers that inspires enthusiasm, as friends in Melbourne arranged a  hanging for me in the Joshua McClelland gallery in Collins Street, to coincide  with the launching and the Press. <em>The Age</em> of November 12, 1959 begins with the following introduction:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Italic12">A Queensland woman now in Melbourne  is having a book published this week and an exhibition of paintings hung next  week&ndash;&ndash;both devoted to Queensland wildflowers. This is part of her  self-appointed task to promote flowers of her State.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">It was all very complimentary, with  three columns for me and a photograph.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard">One would not expect anything of such  style in Brisbane, but bookseller Watty Thomson of Queen Street provided space  for a wide collection in his shop and the noted Gertrude Langer gave me an  interview and added a short appreciation in the <em>Courier-Mail</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">It must have  been just coincidence, but the National Library in Canberra also involved  itself by association with Sir Joseph Banks and his life interest in Australian  flora and fauna, especially the Investigator survey with botanist Robert Brown,  artist Ferdinand Bauer, commanded by Matthew Flinders in the first decade of  the 19th century.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="Italic12"><em>Queensland wildflowers: </em></span><span class="TextStandard"><em>A selection</em> was part of that display and [it was] only  by good luck that I saw it&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="TextStandard">The buzz you may be hearing was the  &lsquo;kick-start&rsquo; that got the ball rolling for thirty years, thirty years devoted  to the &lsquo;art of seeing&rsquo;. Seeing what had been invisible to many because it had  never been imprinted on the mind that couldn&rsquo;t see for itself.</p>
