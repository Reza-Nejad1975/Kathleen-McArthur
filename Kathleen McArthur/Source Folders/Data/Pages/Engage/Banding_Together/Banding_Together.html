                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>MEETING DISCUSSES BRANCH OF WILDLIFE PRESERVATION SOCIETY</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A  meeting on Wednesday 14th November at the residence of Mrs. K. McArthur,  Caloundra, to discuss the formation of a Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife  Preservation Society of Queensland, was very well attended.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mr.  J. Geddes, who chaired the meeting, said: &lsquo;I would like to welcome you here  tonight. Mrs. McArthur is going to tell you the objects of this meeting. This  is the first effort outside of Brisbane to form a branch, and I hope this idea  will mushroom on and do a lot of good&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;This idea,&rsquo; explained Mrs.  McArthur, &lsquo;grew out of a letter written by David Fleay and Judith Wright,  calling for more training in schools concerning the knowledge of wild life.  Nothing is done in schools except through individual teachers. If our aim is to  publish a magazine that would be free to schools then we must have a society to  back us. We called a public meeting in Brisbane in September which was well  attended, and formed the Wildlife Preservation Society&rsquo;. Mrs. McArthur then  read the rules and constitution of this society.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;The main work at present being  done,&rsquo; said Mrs. McArthur &lsquo;is the magazine. It will be published quarterly and  have forty-eight pages and will be lavishly illustrated. All areas of the State  will be dealt with and people will be shown what to look for at different  seasons. We hope there will be many Branches formed throughout the State. Our  work in Caloundra would be conserving beach dunes, preserving patches of scrub  in the districts, sand spits extending out of Happy Valley, replant foreshores,  plant native trees and shrubs at High School [sic] and put regular Nature notes in  the <em>Caloundra Weekly</em>. Suitable native  trees could be planted in the local streets and avenues and a reference section  [placed] in the School of Arts Library and in School Libraries&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;As  most of you know I have been interested in research in bird life,&rsquo; said Mr.  Galletly, &lsquo;and there are some very interesting species in this district. A lot  of destruction of rare bird life in Caloundra is caused by stray cats. Someone  dumped a cat and her kittens on my property recently and the cat promptly  killed a pair of pet opossums [sic] and many of my birds. I would like to tell  the people of Caloundra if you have any unwanted animal to get in touch with  the Health Inspector and he will send the Pound Keeper to take the animal away.  I understand kangaroos roaming over the golf course here have been shot and I  would like to know more about this, as it is not legal to shoot in this area.  Since I have been here I have recorded 145 species of birds&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mr.  Geddes [said], &lsquo;It is obvious it is high time a Society should be started here.  I belong to the Golf Club and have not heard of any shooting of kangaroos.  Shooting is not allowed there&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs.  Marson [said], &lsquo;I have a love of flora and fauna and the corner by the golf  course is very beautiful and should be preserved&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs.  Nelson Gracie [said], &lsquo;This club should do a lot to educate our children and  give them a love of their natural heritage&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs.  Enid Card [said], &lsquo;To develop and preserve our wildlife would be in the  interest of the tourist business in Caloundra. People come here to see  wildflowers that are never seen in the South&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mr.  Geddes then introduced Mr. Babbage from the Forestry Department who said he was  most interested in the formation of this Branch and that its activities would  be followed with interest by members of the Forestry Department.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> After a further discussion it was decided there  was sufficient local interest to go ahead and form a Caloundra Branch of the  Society.</p>

                    <p class="Heading1">THE WILD LIFE PRESERVATION SOCIETY OF  QUEENSLAND&ndash;&ndash;CALOUNDRA BRANCH</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1962, in three states of Australia,  societies were formed for the conservation and preservation of our natural  resources. This is indicative of a world-wide feeling that we are using the  land without due thought for the future.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The aims of these movements are not to  halt development that is part of a nation&rsquo;s economy, but rather to use more  foresight and intelligence in such action, so that future generations may not  be left without resources or inherit a sterile land. These problems are being  tackled on an international level by such a body as the I.U.C.N. (International  Union for the Conservation of Nature), with its headquarters in Switzerland,  and by various national bodies. In Australia, conservation is handled by the  separate states and as yet, has not been made a national concern, hence these  state societies which are closely affiliated. In a few short months of their  existence they have developed a close contact with each other and also with the  overseas national and international associations.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">At the other end of the scale we see  such comings-together on the parochial level as the recent formation of the  Noosa Parks Development Association. This is how it should be, and assuredly  will be, for local organisations to cope with local problems, state bodies to  direct wider policy and so on, and up, to national and international  organisations.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Much destruction of the natural  landscape and consequently the wildlife it supported has occurred in the  Caloundra district since the war, but there is still a great deal for us to  save, and if co-operation is forthcoming, to build upon for the future.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Having such hope  in mind, a meeting is being called for Wednesday 20th March at 8 p.m. in the  Wildflower Room, Midyim, King&rsquo;s Beach, Caloundra, to form a Caloundra Branch of  the Wild Life Preservation Society of Queensland. All those who may be  interested in such matters are invited to attend.</p>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">WILDLIFE PRESERVATION MEETING</h1>
<p class="TextStandard">On Wednesday, 20th March at 8 p.m., a  number of residents gathered at the home of Mrs. Kathleen McArthur in Orvieto  Terrace to form a Caloundra branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland.  Once the decision was made to form a branch, which will be the first branch of  this Society in Queensland, an election of officers resulted in: Mr. J. Geddes,  president; Mrs. K. McArthur, secretary and treasurer; executive committee,  Messrs. I. Bevage from the Forestry Department, and S. Galletly. It was moved  and seconded that a letter be written to the Landsborough Shire Council  informing them of the formation of this Branch, and seeking their co-operation  in the future.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs.  McArthur read a letter from a private resident, pointing out the potential of a  park reserve at Moffat Beach, and two members were appointed to look over this  area and report back at the next meeting. Another letter, from the Noosa Parks  Development Association, was read by the Secretary. Mrs. McArthur said the  Noosa Association was a very live body with over 100 members and they were  working hard to keep the interest alive among the local people. Lists had been  made of the various wildflowers in the area, and many interesting nature films  had been shown. Mr. Geddes said the more groups formed along the coast the  better it would be for the development of the coastal areas.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It  was decided that members should contribute nature notes to the <em>Caloundra Weekly</em> under the heading &lsquo;Wildlife  and Landscape&rsquo; to arouse the interest of the general public, and all members  were asked to canvas for increased membership for the Caloundra Branch.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A great deal of discussion followed the announcement  that much of the strip of land that follows the lake at Currimundi had been  cleared of all natural growth, and as this area is famous for its wildflowers,  members were asked to examine the territory and to report back at the next  meeting.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs.  Nottidge said she had been shocked at the lack of trees in a town such as  Caloundra where shade trees were urgently needed. Mr. Geddes said members would  have noticed how the Council are now planting a number of trees; but it would  be impossible for the Council to plant all the trees needed in this area and to  maintain them. This association should encourage people to grow their own trees  and do what they can to assist them. Mr. Geddes said he was quite sure they  would have the co-operation of many of the clubs in Caloundra. One whose  support he knew they would have was the Golf Club. The members of this club  were planning an 18-hole course and would soon be at the stage when they would  be planting new trees. This area, said Mr. Geddes, comprised nearly 100 acres,  and sheltered much wildlife including kangaroos, wallabies and even a few  koalas. The Golf Club would be glad of any advice the association could give  them.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> It  was decided to hold meetings every third Wednesday in the month at 8 p.m. at  the residence of Mrs. K. McArthur, Orvieto Terrace. New members will be made  welcome.</p>

<h1 class="Heading1">FIRST ANNUAL WILDLIFE PRESERVATION SOCIETY MEETING</h1>
<p class="TextStandard">Mr.  John Geddes, President of the Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife Preservation  Society, presented his report at the first annual meeting of the Society held  at Caloundra recently. He said the inaugural meeting of this branch was held on  the 15th March [actually 20 March] 1963, and since that date the membership has  shown a steady increase until the branch now has twenty-eight members. This is  a satisfactory rate of growth, as it is our aim to gain members interested in  the object of the Society rather than gain large numbers of indifferent  supporters.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The  Branch has held twelve meetings, four of which have been entirely devoted to  lectures by the following guest speakers:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mr.  Charles Roff&ndash;&ndash;Fauna Officer in Queensland<br />
                    Dr.  Len Webb&ndash;&ndash;C.S.I.R.O. Forest Ecologist<br />
                    Mr.  Hardie Buzacott&ndash;&ndash;Authority on the Cooloola Sands<br />
                    Mr.  Selwyn Everist&ndash;&ndash;Government Botanist</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The lectures  attracted a great deal of interest in the district and attendances reached a  peak figure of seventy members and visitors. I have no doubt that these  lectures have materially assisted in the establishment of this branch, as well  as providing interesting and stimulating evenings for the members.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Another  important activity of the branch has been the weekly publication of articles  appearing under the title &lsquo;Wildlife and Landscape&rsquo; in the <em>Caloundra Weekly</em>, the <em>Maroochydore  Advertiser</em> and the <em>North Coast Comet</em>.  These articles have created tremendous interest amongst the local residents in  our own and surrounding districts. I formally thank the contributors for their  splendid efforts on behalf of the branch.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A  further successful project was the sale of native trees, organised just before  Christmas. The cost of the trees has virtually been recouped and many suitable  trees have been distributed for planting in the district. Some stock remains  and is being cared for by the secretary, who reports that sales are continuing.  Whilst on this subject, I must mention that several members have planted trees  in gardens for owners who are unable to do so themselves.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It  is interesting to note that requests for advice have been received by the  Branch from several groups interested in the planting. The Caloundra Golf Club  and the Lions Club are two groups that come to mind. In all cases we have been  able to assist, and in the latter we supplied forty-five trees and a plan for  their planting.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In  conclusion, I wish to thank our very hard-working secretary, Mrs. K. McArthur,  for the tremendous amount of work she has done for this branch and the Society.  She has, at all times, carried out her duties with great zeal and efficiency.  At present she is keeping a record for 1964 of local birds observed between  Bell&rsquo;s Creek and Noosa on the coast, to Kondalilla National Park and Mary  Cairncross Park to the ranges. I shall leave further details for her to report.  Suffice to say that the progress of the Society and of this branch in  particular is in part due to the unsparing efforts of our secretary.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">I  must draw your attention to the efforts of our treasurer Mrs. J. Nelson Gracie.  She has looked after our financial problems so ably we find we have none. As  well as to those two hard-working officers my thanks go to all you members who  have taken a keen interest in the Society and assisted in many ways. I trust  you will continue to support the Society in all its activities.</p>
                    <span class="TextStandard"> The  secretary, Kathleen McArthur&rsquo;s report will be given in later issues.</span>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>REVIEWING  TEN YEARS</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Come June it will be ten years since  four pe<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Reviewing_10_years.jpg" width="250" height="471" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ople resolved to form the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland.  Those four were Brian Clouston of Jacaranda Press, whose idea it was, and David  Fleay, Judith Wright and myself, to whom he put his proposal.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Brian Clouston offered to publish a  natural history magazine for Queenslanders for which a society was needed to  provide voluntary contributors. And so &lsquo;Wildlife in Australia&rsquo; (first titled  simply &lsquo;Wildlife&rsquo;), a quarterly, was first published. After the very first  issues, by demands from other States, it quickly became a national magazine.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In theory, our plan was that a copy  should go free to all primary schools in Queensland, distributed through the  Education Department. That scheme fell through, not because of any failure on  our part. Nowadays, the Education Department subsidises it by 50 per cent when  it is ordered through the Department.<br />
                    While &lsquo;Wildlife in Australia&rsquo; is now  paying its way and paying an editor, assistant editor and production manager  (it is printed by the <em>Courier-Mail</em> in  Brisbane), all contributions are still honorary. It is a fine magazine of which  we are mightily proud.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Initially, the  Society was literally concerned with wildlife, ie, flora and fauna. Soon it was  to be seen that this was too limiting and evolved into a concern for a  broadened concept of conservation when the term &lsquo;conservationist,&rsquo; then often  used derogatorily, slipped into local common usage. Within the past year, under  threats of supersonic transport, we have broadened our outlook still further  and conservationists are rapidly becoming environmentalists. Conservative  thinkers, as so many of our politicians, departmental officers and local  authority officers are, find it difficult to keep up with these expansions.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Reviewing our campaigns, there seem to  have been too few firm decisions. One of our first projects, in 1963, was an  objection to two mining applications for Cooloola, followed the next year by  our carefully prepared proposal for a large Cooloola National Park. These  applications were withdrawn after a well-mounted campaign supported by a large  number of organisations.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The story of the eleven applications  that sparked off the bitter fight between the &lsquo;people&rsquo;, not just the  &lsquo;conservationists&rsquo; on the one side and the mining companies, backed by  Government members, on the other, is too well-known to be repeated here. What  is not fully realised is that the last chapter is still not written, as no  National Park has yet been publicly defined. We know that it cannot be gazetted  because at the height of the controversy the Mines Department renewed an  Authority to Prospect, but there is no logical reason why the &lsquo;people&rsquo; should not  be told how this Cooloola National Park is planned. AND TOLD NOW!</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Next was an application to mine Ellison  Reef for limestone. Ellison Reef, offshore from Innisfail, is part of the Great  Barrier Reef. This campaign of objection was brilliantly carried through to  success by the Innisfail Branch under the ebullient leadership of the late John  Busst, of Bingil Bay, and with support from all over the world led to the  setting-up of the currently sitting Royal Commission on the Reef. What the  final outcome [will be] for the preservation of this precious natural wonder  remains to be known.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Nearer home and nearer this date are  our Caloundra Branch projects over the past seven months. Although climaxing in  this time, the Currimundi&ndash;Point Cartwright beach is a matter that we, as  individuals, have been involved with since 1960 when the bulldozing of the  Point Cartwright dunes first revealed to us that the Government had signed a  contract with the developers which permitted them to destroy the beach dunes in  return for a road and three bridges.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">At present we are awaiting a decision  on our proposal to have that beach included in our local Beach Erosion Control  District, and also another proposal to have a 3-mile x 8-chain area from high  water back over the dunes, to be rescinded from the Development Lease and added  to the Wildflower Reserve. Two mining applications for the area, one dating  back to last year, which we are opposing, will not be heard until June 19. And  at this very moment of writing we are impatiently waiting to see what our  Government will do about the developer who proceeded with a road closure before  the final date for objections.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">No mean aspect of the Branch&rsquo;s activity  has been the bringing to Caloundra of a constant series of fine lecturers, many  of world renown. The latest is Professor L. S. Hamilton of Cornell University,  U.S.A., who will give an address at the Hotel Perle this Thursday, May 4, at 8  p.m. For anyone interested in a world view on conservation issues, this lecture  is a must. Mike Ahern, who played a vital role in bringing the professor to  Queensland, will introduce him, and Roger Jeffries will move the vote of  thanks. Both Mike and Roger are Society members of long standing.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">No, The Wildlife Preservation Society  has no apology to make to the Queensland people after ten years of dedicated  voluntary work.</p>
