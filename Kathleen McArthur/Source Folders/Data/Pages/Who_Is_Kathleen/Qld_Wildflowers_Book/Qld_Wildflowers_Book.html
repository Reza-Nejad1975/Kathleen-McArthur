                    <p class="TextStandard">This small book is published in the  year of Queensland&rsquo;s hundredth birthday. It is the first popular book intended  to help us identify our wildflowers, and to show us where they may be found and  at what times of year. I hope the response to its publication will be  enthusiastic enough to show that at last we are beginning to appreciate our own  native flowers and understand the necessity of preserving them from  destruction. They are our own inheritance and ought to be our pride, but today  they are urgently in need of saving from the foolish indifference of those who  with fire and bulldozers are clearing our coastal plains for settlement, or by careless  lighting of fires are endangering our forests and mountain flora. This book  ought to show us that our own flowering plants and trees are unique and are  well worth our attention and care.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">These exact and beautiful  colour-plates, which form only a very small part of Kathleen McArthur&rsquo;s devoted  work in wildflower painting, form an excellent introduction to the study of  Queensland flowers, particularly for the southern coastal areas where she has  mainly worked. If we use them to show us where and when to look for our  wildflowers, we will soon begin to recognise their beauty; but when we do find  them, let us leave them where they are to seed and grow naturally. Such  striking flowers as our <em>Hibiscus  splendens</em>, or the richly purple Hovea of the coast, would look well in our  gardens, perhaps, but they are better ordered from nurseries which can supply  them without denuding their native growing-grounds. What we shall soon  need&ndash;&ndash;what we need now, with our increasing urbanisation&ndash;&ndash;is more wildflower  reserves, more parks, and sanctuaries where these flowers can be seen as they  should be, in their own environment; and if we use this book well, we will soon  be demanding these, and also demanding more and larger popular guides to our  wildflowers and their places and seasons of blooming. We will teach our  children, too, to take care of these flowers and love them. They are, after  all, unique in the world&rsquo;s flora, and many of them grow nowhere else.</p>

                    <p><span class="Heading1"><strong>Author&rsquo;s Preface, in Kathleen McArthur </strong></span><strong><em class="ItalicBold14">Queensland wildflowers: a selection</em><span class="Heading1">,  1959, Brisbane, Jacaranda Press</span></strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Queensland wildflowers deserve more  than this small book, but as finance for large works with coloured  illustrations is not readily  available, this selection may serve as an introduction to the subject. Its  sixty flowers in colour with additional flowers from the Wallum drawn on the  endpapers are but an infinitesimal part of the whole. The native flowers of  this State lack neither numbers nor quality, only publicity.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">While publicity  for the wildflowers of Western Australia began nearly three hundred years ago  with William Dampier, Queensland wildflowers are still practically unknown.  Early this century Mrs Ellis Rowan painted a number of our flowers, some of  which were used to illustrate &lsquo;The Comprehensive Catalogue of Queensland  Plants&rsquo; by Bailey, and more were hung in the Queensland Museum. In the twenties  Mrs Estelle Thomson brought out a small booklet with delightful water-colour  and line-drawing illustrations. This was to be the first of a series but  unfortunately the financial depression that followed prevented further  publication. These two efforts appear to be all that has been done to make  Queensland wildflowers known to the public. Therefore, this little work is  apparently the first popular book on Queensland wildflowers.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The State has  been known for its fine botanists whose technical publications serve the  specialist, yet little has previously been done to bridge the gap between  scientist and the public. It is the general public who, in the end, are  responsible for the preservation of our floral heritage, and the delay in  serving them could be vital.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The wildflowers  of a nation play a big part in its culture. Indigenous culture grows as slowly  to maturity as the long-living trees of the forest. Ours is still young and  delicate and we must save the heritage of the land to nurture it. What is not  recognisable will not be saved. So, with great urgency let us get to know our  wildflowers and it will follow that we will love them and desire their  preservation.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The following  text is written mainly for Caloundra. The times and habit of flowering differ  within a few miles and therefore generalised information is unreliable for most  areas of the State. The only exceptions to be found are on Plate IX which  includes flowers found at The Summit on the Granite Belt.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">For those  readers unfamiliar with the name, Wallum is the usually flat, badly drained  sandy country of the coast. It is an aboriginal word some say applied to all  species of Banksia, and others say to <em>Banksia  aemula</em>. The Wallum, being up to the present practically useless for  commercial purposes provides our best wildflower shows; due, of course, to lack  of interference from man and his introduced beasts.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In bushland  ecology native flowers and their fruits are an essential link, for without them  certain insects, animals and birds would not survive. The National Parks are  here the most important aspect of preservation. Their work can be extended with  benefit to all by sympathy and emulation from local authorities, groups and  individuals until, as in Western Australia, the entire State becomes wildflower  conscious. That is the ideal.</p>
