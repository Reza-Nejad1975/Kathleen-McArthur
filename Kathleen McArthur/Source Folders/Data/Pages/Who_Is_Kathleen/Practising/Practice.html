                    <p class="TextStandard">With the theme for World Environment  Day this year towar<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Practice_what_she_preaches.jpg" width="250" height="180" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ds a conserver society, it seems appropriate to write about  a person for whom conservation is a way of life.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur is well-known as a  writer, wildflower artist and a tireless campaigner for the natural  environment. For many years it was a one-woman campaign, beginning in the 1940s  with her concern about the wholesale destruction of the sand dunes.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Understanding of beach ecology was  non-existent in those days. The sand dunes were being bulldozed out of  existence and people could not understand why anyone should make a fuss about  that. After all without the obstruction of the dunes one could enjoy a view of  the ocean without having to leave the car. Despite the apathy and sometimes  even hostile reaction to her pleas for the preservation of the dunes and  foreshores (a typical comment was from a Council who admonished her not to be  childish), Kathleen&rsquo;s concern for the beaches increased. However, it was to be  a lonely fight for many years. The Beach Protection Authority was formed only  thirteen years ago.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It was a similar story with the  wildflowers, and particularly the beloved wallum. Dismayed at the destruction  of the wallum wildflower habitat for ill-sited, poorly planned housing  developments, Kathleen intensified her study, writing and painting of the  wildflowers.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">To use her own words from the preface  to her book, <em>Queensland Wildflowers</em>,  Jacaranda Press, 1959, &lsquo;The Wildflowers of a nation play a big part in its  culture. Indigenous culture grows as slowly to maturity as the long-living  trees of the forest. Ours is still young and delicate and we must save the  heritage of the land to nurture it. What is not recognisable will not be saved.  So, with great urgency let us get to know our wildflowers and it will follow  that we will love them and desire their preservation&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">After the founding of the Wildlife  Preservation Society of Queensland in 1962 (Kathleen, Judith Wright, David  Fleay and Brian Clouston were co-founders) the battle was not quite such a  lonely one, but it became an increasingly desperate one with increasing  destruction of the coastal strip by developers in the name of progress.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The story is different now with active  conservation groups from Caloundra to Noosa. Symptomatic of community concern  is Maroochy Shire Council&rsquo;s determination to have part of Suncoast  Development&rsquo;s holdings set aside as a wildflower reserve.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t until people realise that  they&rsquo;ve lost something, but they begin to value it. There is more hope now,  that much of what remains may be saved, or at least that future development  will be planned and carried out in a more environmentally sympathetic way,&rsquo;  Kathleen McArthur said. &lsquo;There is never sufficient hope to relax, even a  national park can be revoked by Act of Parliament. Nothing is safe if someone  bright covets it.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The foregoing has given a more  incomplete sketch of the lifelong dedication and work of a remarkable woman,  Kathleen McArthur, conservationist. But there is another side to conservation  and another side to Kathleen, which few people are aware of.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Looking at Midyim, Kathleen&rsquo;s  comfortable chamferboard house at King&rsquo;s Beach, one would not immediately be  aware that the lifestyle of its owner was different from others. Certainly she  must be a little eccentric to have all those trees and shrubs growing in such a  jungle that you can hardly see the house, but&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">An observant sleuth, however, would  notice that although Caloundra has a twice-weekly garbage collection there are  rarely any bins to be emptied at Midyim even though the house is occupied. The  fact that there is no accumulation of rubbish at Midyim for the garbage  collectors is evidence of the other side of conservation in practice&ndash;&ndash;an old  fashioned form of conservation which was important to our grandmothers, but  which was easily forgotten, even scoffed at, during the prosperous affluent  decades following World War II.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When shopping Kathleen takes her own  basket and paper bags. She refuses the smart plastic shopping bags in which  many retailers pack goods. In fact she avoids over-packages altogether, and she  particularly avoids plastic. Only liquids in glass bottles or jars are bought.  Kathleen explains that unlike glass, plastic cannot be recycled. It is not  biodegradable and when burnt it gives off noxious fumes. Because milk comes in  plastic-coated cartons Kathleen uses evaporated milk, which comes in cans which  can be bashed, buried and will rust away. Greasy papers and food scraps are  buried in the garden. Bottles and any other glass are taken to the city rubbish  dump at Caloundra where licensed dealers collect them for recycling. Cardboard  and clean waste paper is taken to an Endeavour Workshop bin for recycling. It  is impossible to avoid plastic altogether. The few bits such as cheese wrapping  which do come in to the house are lightly screwed up in a bag and buried. The  only items ever put into the garbage bin are torch batteries (they don&rsquo;t get  recycled), and bits of litter picked up from the street outside Midyim.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Of particular concern is the amount of  water wasted in most households. The laundry, bathroom and kitchen at Midyim  are connected to the town water supply. In addition, there is a rainwater tank  to provide drinking water and cooking. But because of the enormous cost and  destruction involved in impounding water to bring it to urban areas, Kathleen  is as careful as any countrywoman to conserve water. She is also concerned  about the damage to the environment caused by excess water from drains and  sewers.</p>
                    <p><span class="TextStandard"> Perhaps  we&rsquo;ve given ourselves more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth with all our electric  appliances and gadgets. Perhaps the old ways were simpler and better; Kathleen  certainly thinks so.</span>
