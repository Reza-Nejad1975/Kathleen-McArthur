                    <p class="TextStandard">Advancing years have calmed Caloundra&rsquo;s  environmen<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Kathleen_keeps_on_fighting.jpg" width="230" height="519" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />tal watchdog Kathleen McArthur, but they have not reduced the  strength of her convictions. At 68, she is just as firmly committed to  protecting the natural environment as ever.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Her home of the last 41 years gives an  insight into this author, painter and environmentalist. The two-storey wooden  house is within earshot of the Kings Beach breakers and the yard is overgrown  because she prefers to leave it in its natural state. Kathleen sits in her  living room where books and other literature are stacked high on crammed  shelves. Sea-shells line the top of an open window through which the ocean  breeze blows.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Surrounded by papers relating to  Pumicestone Passage, she says: &lsquo;I used to be very emotionally disturbed but I  realised it was self-destructive. I am calmer now, but then again I am a lot  older. But emotionalism is very necessary to give people the drive to act. I  have always tried to play it low key because when you become a name, people are  more interested in you than your message.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen could not keep her name out of  the 1969 campaign against mining of the Cooloola coloured sands. She also gave  evidence at a hearing on the issue. The campaign involved the printing of  postcards which were sent to the Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the end result  was victory&ndash;&ndash;declaration of the Cooloola National Park.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Such experiences have taught her a few  lessons. &lsquo;Keep the issue simple and clear. Don&rsquo;t confuse it with separate  issues. There are a lot of conservationists who are irrational. They want  everything at once.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">Her last eight years have been devoted  to, among other interests, studying coastal management and estuary ecology. A  proposal to declare a marine park in Pumicestone Passage is her major talking  point at the moment. And she can talk about it for hours. Her research involved  wading through a 1600-page government committee&rsquo;s report on environment and  conservation, and other literature. In a submission to the State Co-ordinator  General she will oppose the proposal. She says fish life is protected under the  current fisheries habitat and wetlands reserves, but if the Passage is declared  a marine park it could be used for multiple purposes.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">Kathleen has been observing the Passage  ever since her family started holidaying at Caloundra, where she delighted in  climbing among the rock pools and swimming.</span></p>
                    <h1 class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard"><span class="Text12Bold">Passage Battle Looms</span></span></h1>
                    <h1 class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">But annual holidays were not enough.  She visited Caloundra almost every weekend when she was old enough to drive.  &lsquo;When I went overseas after I got married I think I was homesick for  Caloundra&ndash;&ndash;not Brisbane,&rsquo; she says.</span></h1>
<p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">She watched the destruction of frontal  sand dunes at Kings Beach following the removal of wire fences soon after World  War Two. Angered by the destruction of part of the beach she loved, she fought  a lone losing battle to preserve the dunes. That taught her another lesson. &lsquo;An  individual cannot do much alone,&rsquo; she explains. &lsquo;With politicians it&rsquo;s numbers  that count. You would condemn this sort of thing, but it&rsquo;s done out of  ignorance. They never seem to ask for any advice.&rsquo;</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">Kathleen cannot pinpoint who shaped her  environmental instincts although her father was a marine engineer. &lsquo;I think  it&rsquo;s just me,&rsquo; is her explanation.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">A 1961 trip to the United States to  paint wildflowers rekindled her interest in the environment. She read a paper  on wetlands ecology by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the United States&rsquo;  oldest conservation society. Her interest in waterways has blossomed.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">She is a member of the Massachusetts  Audubon Society, the Noosa Parks Association, Caloundra Branch of the  Queensland Wildlife Association [Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland],  the Sydney-based Coast and Wetlands Society, a life member of the Australian  Conservation Foundation, the David Stead Memorial Foundation, Caloundra  Lunch-hour Theatre and Sunshine Coast Wildflower Society.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">Her published works include <em>The Bush in Bloom</em>, <em>Queensland Wildflowers</em>, <em>Pumicestone  Passage&ndash;&ndash;A Living Waterway</em>, <em>A Living  River&ndash;&ndash;The Noosa</em>, and <em>A Living Beach</em>.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard">Kathleen travels the countryside  painting wildflowers, constantly researches subjects and reads literature which  arrives in her mail box. She is currently writing a follow-up to <em>The Bush in Bloom</em>. She also runs  lunch-hour theatres in schools and in the Caloundra Committee for the Ageing  hall. How does she find the time? &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have much of a social life,&rsquo; she  explains. &lsquo;But it interests me&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s my life.&rsquo;</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><span class="TextStandard"> [This  front page article contains two photos, one captioned &lsquo;Kathleen McArthur&ndash;&ndash;still  firmly committed to the environment.&rsquo; and the other, &lsquo;Kathleen McArthur in the  garden of her Kings Beach home where she has lived for 41 years. Time has  calmed her, but she is still committed to protecting the environment. Her  latest project is the Pumicestone Passage marine park proposal.&rsquo;]</span> </p>
