                    <h4 class="Heading1">KATHLEEN&rsquo;S VISION GAVE COAST A GREEN FUTURE:  Environmentalist devoted her life to preserving native vegetation</h4>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As an artist, author, educator and  conservationist Kath<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Vision.jpg" width="250" height="375" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />leen McArthur was a dogged campaigner for the preservation  of the Sunshine Coast&rsquo;s native vegetation.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;There is no doubt that the  preservation of much of the environment of the Sunshine Coast has been due to  the perseverance of Kathleen McArthur,&rsquo; read the end of the citation awarding  her in 1996 with a Degree of Honorary Doctor of Educational Studies from James  Cook University. Her fight to educate the community to the values of native  vegetation and the need to retain it and of the wonder of native wildflowers  has played a large part in helping establish environmental benchmarks to which  we now aspire.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Born in Brisbane on June 11, 1915,  Kathleen was one of a family of five children. Her father was the co-founder of  Evans Deakins shipyard, and her mother was a member of the Durack family. After  leaving school she worked in the book department of Finney Isles and was an  active book club member.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">She went on to write <em>Queensland Wildflowers&ndash;&ndash;a selection</em>; <em>The Living River&ndash;&ndash;The Noosa</em>; <em>Pumicestone Passage</em>; <em>Bread and Dripping Days</em>; <em>The Bush in Bloom</em>; <em>Looking at Australian Wildflowers</em>; and <em>Living on the Coast</em>.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1938 she married Malcolm McArthur, a  staff corps officer, and lived in India before moving back to Australia with  the outbreak of World War II. She lived in Perth, Duntroon and Melbourne  bearing three children. Before war&rsquo;s end she moved to Caloundra and the home  she occupied to her death.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen&rsquo;s divorce in 1947 saw her turn  to painting, and the cataloguing of native wildflowers, in both book form and  watercolours. Frustration over environmental ignorance led to her involvement  in the formation of the Queensland Wildlife Preservation Society in 1962, and  the establishment of the Caloundra branch a year later. She ran field trips,  gave lectures, organised the propagation and sale of native plants leading to  the inaugural wildflower show first held at her home in 1967, and through her  paintings, books and a weekly column Wildlife and Landscape in the <em>Sunshine Coast Advertiser</em> and then <em>The Chronicle</em>, fought to increase  awareness of the environment.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen was critically aware of the  need to achieve outcomes. She mounted the first postcard campaign in Australia  pushing preservation of what is now Cooloola National Park from sandmining, and  the Wallum Pastures Scheme in 1969. Kathleen was a champion of the Pumicestone  Passage, successfully lobbying for its inclusion in the Register of the  National Estate.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> Her  passion, knowledge and commitment have ensured that the waves of development  that have surged through the region over the past 30 years have not been allowed  to obliterate its natural charm.</p>

                    <p>A TIGERISH fighter for the enviro<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/A_fighter.jpg" width="126" height="319" align="right" />nment  has been chosen as the <em>Daily</em>&rsquo;s  Sunshine Coast Citizen of the Century.</p>
                    <p>In a decision acknowledged by the  selection panel as controversial, the late Caloundra-based conservationist,  artist, author, educator and activist Kathleen McArthur was chosen ahead of  several other nominees who have been major contributors to the Coast&rsquo;s growth  and prosperity. Included among them were long-time Maroochy shire chairman  Eddie De Vere, who virtually dragged the shire out of rural obscurity through  his pursuit of balanced development, and philanthropist and developer Des  Scanlan.</p>
                    <p>The panel, however, felt that Kathleen  McArthur's passionate commitment, meticulous research and articulate advocacy  contributed so significantly to the preservation of the environment that she  fully deserves this honoured place in the region&rsquo;s history.</p>
                    <p>Our  Citizen of the Century not only fought and won many significant battles for our  waterways, beaches, wildlife and landscape, but played a pivotal role in  educating the public to an awareness of environmental fragility. </p>

  <h3 class="Text12Bold">OUR CITIZEN OF THE CENTURY</h3>
  <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur has outshone a fine  selection of <img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Our_citizen.jpg" width="275" height="229" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />candidates to be honoured as the <em>Sunshine Coast</em> <em>Daily</em>&rsquo;s  Citizen of the Century.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Readers nominated citizens they  considered to have made important contributions to the Sunshine Coast in the  period from 1900&ndash;2000. Many worthy names were not among those nominations,  including humanitarian Sir Clem Renouf, politician David Low, who drove  construction of the coast road from Caloundra to Noosa, environmentalist Dr  Arthur Harrold and one-time Premier Sir Frank Nicklin.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur died in 2000, aged  84. She left behind a legacy which will guarantee the Sunshine Coast retains as  its point of difference the wonders of the natural environment.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">The <em>Sunshine  Coast Daily</em> Kathleen McArthur Memorial Scholarship is being set up at the  University of the Sunshine Coast in her honour. The $3500 scholarship will be  awarded annually to a Sunshine Coast high school student entering the  university&rsquo;s Bachelor of Science (Environmental Science) program in the Faculty  of Science.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">It will form a lasting tribute to a  woman who showed that it is possible for individuals to make a difference:  Kathleen McArthur&ndash;&ndash;naturalist, environmental activist, artist, author&ndash;&ndash;our Citizen  of the Century.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard"><strong>[Main  article by Janine Hill]</strong><br />
    Think of Queensland without the Great  Barrier Reef, think of Caloundra without Pumicestone Passage, think of the  Noosa North Shore without the cool green buffer of Cooloola National Park  behind. Think of all these things and think of a world without Kathleen  McArthur.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">The Caloundra-based conservationist,  artist, author, educator and activist realised the importance of each, long  before it was fashionable to be environmentally friendly, and played a significant  role in ensuring that they were preserved for years to come.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Respected and recognised by her peers,  and awarded an honorary doctorate from James Cook University in the late 1990s  for her work, she has now been acknowledged as the Sunshine Coast Citizen of  the Century.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Her campaigns to protect Cooloola from  sandmining and grazing, and to have Pumicestone Passage included in the  Register of the National Estate, are legendary among the Sunshine Coast&rsquo;s  oldest environmental groups.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">With Doctor Arthur Harrold, the  secretary of the Noosa Parks Association, she was a key figure in a 20-year  battle to convince the State Government to gazette Cooloola National Park.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">However, the changes she helped make to  attitudes are perhaps also as important. Jan Oliver, the director of the  Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, credits Kathleen, as well as the  other founding members of the Society&ndash;&ndash;Judith Wright, David Fleay and Brian  Clouston&ndash;&ndash;with raising an awareness of environmental issues in Queensland for the  first time. &lsquo;They were really responsible for getting the ordinary Australian  to demand that the Great Barrier Reef be protected, and subsequently the Marine  Protection Authority was set up and the reef was protected, against the  Queensland Government,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Ms Oliver said the society would  probably not exist if it had not been for Kathleen. &lsquo;Also we wouldn&rsquo;t have the  knowledge of so many beautiful plants and the paintings that she did on the  Sunshine Coast,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">It was a passion for wildflowers that  led to Kathleen&rsquo;s devotion to wider conservation issues, but family and friends  find it difficult to pinpoint where it all began. Her sister, Judy  Nelson-Gracie, said Kathleen was always interested in the outdoors when they  were growing up in the 1920s in the then semi-rural area of Coorparoo,  Brisbane. &lsquo;She was interested in everything,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Cate Thynne, one of Kathleen&rsquo;s three  children, remembers her mother determinedly trying to sketch flowers with an  early model, but very leaky, Biro. She said her mother would go the &lsquo;ends of  the earth&rsquo; to find out the names of things. &lsquo;Once she started on the natural  history, there was no stopping her,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen&rsquo;s &lsquo;all-consuming&rsquo; passion  extended from producing exquisite paintings of wildflowers, to growing them,  selling them, writing about them, and so followed more than six books, as well  as smaller booklets. Brian Clouston, the founder of Jacaranda Press, which  published her first book, remembers her botanical paintings as &lsquo;outstanding&rsquo;. &lsquo;It  was a beautiful book, it really was, particularly in those days,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen became keenly interested in  the wallum country and dunal areas, and tigerishly opposed any development that  would interfere with either.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">In 1962, she helped form the Queensland  Wildlife Preservation Society, and soon after, established the Caloundra  branch.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Jillian Rossiter, past-president of the  Sunshine Coast Environment Council, and Jill Chamberlain, honorary secretary of  the Wildlife Preservation Society of Caloundra [sic], credit Kathleen with  breaking new ground in environmental campaigns. &lsquo;She was the first person in  Australia, the first environmentalist, to run a postcard campaign. In the &lsquo;60s,  she had postcards printed so that people could fill in the postcards and send  them to those in authority,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">While Kathleen was a thorn in the side  of bureaucracy and of the government led by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, his  successor, Mike Ahern, had a healthy respect for Kathleen and her achievements.  She had many discussions with the MP after he was elected to parliament in 1968  and he later set up the Beach Protection Authority. Mr Ahern said the Sunshine  Coast could well have been a different place if it had not been for Kathleen&rsquo;s  efforts to raise awareness of the need to protect the natural environment. &lsquo;She  played her part, along with others, in ensuring that it didn&rsquo;t become an  endless, sprawling kind of urbanity,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Both Jillian Rossiter and Jill  Chamberlain regard Kathleen as a woman before her time, speaking out&ndash;&ndash;when  women generally didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;about saving an environment that many thought didn&rsquo;t  need to be saved. &lsquo;It was so difficult for her in that time because she was a  female. But Kathleen had such a presence, she was well educated, she was a  dignified person, and she was so articulate, that people had to take notice of  her,&rsquo; Jillian said.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur died in 2000, aged  84.</p>
  <p class="TextStandard">In recognition of her achievements, the  Caloundra Wildlife Preservation Society is seeking to have the Currimundi  Conservation park renamed in her honour.</p>
  <span class="TextStandard"> Golden  Beach State School, for which she wrote a book, <em>Little Fishes of Pumicestone Passage</em>, also has a wallum garden  dedicated to her memory.</span>
