                    <p class="TextStandard">From the 1960s into the 1970s the  battle to preserve Cooloola as a national park was waged by WPSQ and other  community members and groups. This magnificent sand mass of wallum wildflowers,  lakes and coloured sands in the Upper Noosa River region was under threat from  sandmining and grazing.</p>
<p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur was very active in  this campaign, initiating in 1969 Australia&rsquo;s first &lsquo;postcard campaign&rsquo;. It  took off like a &lsquo;hot balloon&rsquo;, resulting in many thousands of &lsquo;Save Cooloola&rsquo;  postcards being sent to the Queensland Premier from people nationwide. <em>The Australian</em> newspaper at the time  described the Caloundra Branch of WPSQ as &lsquo;the most militant conservation cell  in Australia&rsquo; (noted by Kathleen in her Lunch Hour Theatre script <em>One life</em> in August 1995).</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Contributing to the campaign was young  singer-songwriter Keith Bartholomew, who in 1970 composed and recorded <em>Song of Cooloola</em>, a protest song aimed  at the powers-that-be.</p>
                    <span class="TextStandard"> Cooloola  was gazetted as part of the Great Sandy National Park in 1973.</span>

<p class="TextStandard">As has been said before in this series,  the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland does not advocate complete and  all-embracing protection of wildlife. That would not be practical. What is does  advocate is planned use of our national resources, so that commercial  development may continue without unnecessary destruction of the flora, fauna  and landscape.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The national heritage we enjoy is for  our use and the use of future generations, so that we are obliged, when  developing our resources, to guarantee that provision is made for tomorrow&rsquo;s  people. Where it is obvious that current action is unnecessarily abusive, then  we protest.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">At present, the Society is protesting against  the granting of the applications of a mining company for leases to mine the  sand dunes between the Noosa River Bar and Double Island Point.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Queensland has thousands of miles of  beaches, many of which could be mined without large-scale interference with the  balance of nature. Promises are made to rehabilitate the mined areas. This is  never completely successful, although it is the opinion of some people that  improvement is effected, and in some instances authorities have been satisfied.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><img src="../../../../Photos/Dicky_Beach_73.jpg" alt="Dicky Beach erosion fence 73" width="300" height="287" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />The heavy minerals add weight to the  sand and also are a binding element. When they are removed the sand drifts  before the wind much more readily. Complaints about drifting sand in these  &lsquo;rehabilitated&rsquo; areas are constantly appearing in the Press. Even without mining,  when the vegetation on sand is disturbed drifts occur. This is exemplified in  the comparatively small area to the south of Point Cartwright. Although the  most suitable trees were planted there and a barrier erected, roads and  concrete kerbing and even fences have been enveloped in the sand drift and  serious obstruction has been caused in the Mooloolah River. These sand dunes  were only about twenty feet in height. The dunes in the area between Teewah and  Double Island Point range in height up to 750 feet and average probably about  300 feet. They extend for twenty miles. Behind these dunes, in the southern  section, is the newly gazetted Fauna Reserve, which is dependent for fresh  water on Lake Cooloola. Cooloola is a very beautiful, sand-bottomed, but small  lake, famous for its waterfowl. An infinitesimal portion of the volume of sand  in the dunes now protecting the area would fill up and destroy this source of  fresh water.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The northern portion supports fauna and  flora unique on the Australian mainland; found elsewhere only on Fraser Island,  to which, it is believed, it once was joined. Also unique are the magnificent  scenic cliffs of many coloured sands. Only one other place in Australia boasts  such coloured sands and it is thousands of miles away on the coast of West  Australia. Experts agree that once the vegetation on these dunes is removed it  would not be possible to rehabilitate them.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Have we the moral right to allow  interference on such an area, believing as we do that the devastation will be  complete and far reaching? We have not.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">After 150 years of  settlement, first with political domination when a colony followed by economic  domination from interstate and overseas, Queensland won the preservation of  Cooloola by its own will and effort.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The &lsquo;people&rsquo;  won an historic victory against vested interests and power-hungry politicians.  There is a never-to-be-forgotten lesson in this. We identified ourselves with  Cooloola. It became a symbol of our desire to remain Australian even if we must  sacrifice some of the hypothetical &lsquo;standard of living&rsquo; which is really nothing  more than accumulation of possessions, many of which can be happily done  without, while at the same time gaining increased quality in our lives.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Defeat was  unthinkable. We showed that we were not prepared to accept it without  forfeiting peaceful measures. Reason prevailed and so it is best not to repeat  the suggestions made for following a possible defeat.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The next step is  intelligent practical management for the protection of that most unstable sand  mass. As a National Park it will have official protection through the excellent  Fore<img src="../../../../Photos/Cooloola_postcard.jpg" width="300" height="352" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />stry Department&rsquo;s National Parks system. But, from the word &lsquo;go&rsquo;, or more  appropriately the word &lsquo;no&rsquo;, local residents of the area began talking of the  &lsquo;development&rsquo; of the National Park&ndash;&ndash;there was talk of roads and tourist  facilities. Under the Queensland system, National Parks do not have roads  through them. Access to a park is usually provided, but not always as example  the Mooloolah River National Park, but roads are not put through National  Parks.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In the lifetime of  the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland (8 years last week) we have had  to battle two such proposals, one for an esplanade road around the Noosa  National Park and the other a road through the famous Lamington National Park  from Binna Burra to O&rsquo;Reillys. Fortunately we won both, despite a considerable  amount of authorative opposition. One of the excuses for roads that was used  was that our National Parks should also be available to the old and the  crippled, to which one octogenarian woman replied: &lsquo;There is nowhere else for  the old to walk in safety nowadays but in National Parks&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cooloola is  under-sized as a wilderness area, yet, as it is all we have left, we must first  and foremost preserve its wilderness quality. If we do this we will attract a  new category of tourists&ndash;&ndash;as the campaigning through the past year has shown.  Cooloola is for those who identify with a landscape unadulterated by man. The  &lsquo;magic&rsquo; of Cooloola is a very precious heritage as such, to be loved and  cherished and protected.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;The Song of Cooloola&rsquo;, having been  launched successfully by <img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Cooloola_is_still_in_the_news.jpg" width="175" height="320" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />the composer Keith Bartholomew of Nambour, is now  spreading throughout the land. Every donor to the Caloundra Branch of the  Wildlife Preservation Society&rsquo;s appeal for funds to cover the expenses of the  recent hearing in the Mining Warden&rsquo;s Court at Gympie&ndash;&ndash;and they number about  500&ndash;&ndash;is receiving a complimentary copy. So also are people concerned with  entertainment and news media. Already, Martin Collins of <em>The Australian</em> has given it amusing coverage (25.5.70). The <em>Nambour Chronicle</em> of 26.5.70 also wrote  it up. A disc is to be cut for distribution. Very soon every one will be  hearing &lsquo;The Song of Cooloola&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><strong class="Text12Bold">Coast Promotion</strong><br />
                      I hope it is realised by those tourist  promoters of the Sunshine Coast that there never has been a wider promotion of  the Sunshine Coast than these campaigns for the preservation of Cooloola:  95,000 protest cards, 10,000 brochures, 10,000 letters, 10,000 Cooloola  Wildflower folders in colour have been distributed throughout Australia to  individuals and approximately 500 organisations. </p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Press coverage of our Cooloola  Campaigns has been extensive over the past six months, without a pause&ndash;&ndash;all  indirectly advertising the district. Press coverage included local, provincial,  state and national papers. Periodicals such as <em>Walkabout</em>, <em>Tradition</em> (a  folk song publication), <em>Outlook</em> (a  socialist current affairs magazine), <em>The  Australian Beekeeper</em>, as well as innumerable newsletters of conservation  organizations throughout Australia have presented the Cooloola case with  sympathy. A.B.C. radio, with emphasis from a Guest of Honour, Professor L.S.  Hamilton of Cornell University in New York State, has covered it, as too has  A.B.C. television in current affairs programmes (twice on Today Tonight) and  news programmes. This promotion has cost the Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife  Preservation Society thousands of dollars, with more added from the Noosa Parks  Development Association&ndash;&ndash;money willingly spent to preserve Cooloola. Labour,  being non-professional, is donated.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><strong class="Text12Bold">Vital</strong><br />
                      The preservation of the whole of  Cooloola is of vital importance to the tourist industry of the Sunshine Coast.  The Noosa Shire realized this and objected to the mining applications, as our  other Shire Councils might well have done. They are being asked to contribute  ratepayers&rsquo; money to tourist promotion, but what are they promoting? It came  out in evidence at the Gympie Mining Warden&rsquo;s Court hearing that the north side  of Brisbane, within an eighty miles radius, has less than eighth the acreage of  the National Parks to the south of Brisbane within the same radius. If our  Chambers of Commerce think that all tourists want a bed, breakfast and a game  of bowls then they are not in tune with the wants of tourists, especially  overseas tourists. Cooloola is vital. Queensland needs Cooloola. So come all  you local tourist promoters and support the case for Cooloola. Demand of your  State Government that Cooloola be preserved&ndash;&ndash;all of Cooloola. If the high dunes  are mined Cooloola is desecrated. It is now or never.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t destroy Cooloola, beautiful  Cooloola. Don&rsquo;t destroy Cooloola on the sunny Sunshine Coast,&rsquo; to quote the  refrain of &lsquo;The Song Of Cooloola&rsquo;. </p>
