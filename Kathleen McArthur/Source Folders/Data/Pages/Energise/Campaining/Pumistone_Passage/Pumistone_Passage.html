                    <p class="Heading1"><span class="TextStandard">The campaign to protect the Pumicestone  Passage, a complex marine habitat and Ramsar wetland with tidal entrances at  Caloundra and the southern end of Bribie Island, was fought with great passion  by Kathleen McArthur. Her book <em>Pumicestone  Passage: a living waterway</em> formed the basis for a submission to protect the  values of the Passage against the threat of dredging for residential canal  development.</span></p>
<p class="TextStandard">Following other threats from woodchip  plant and paper mill proposals, and more campaigning, the Moreton Bay Marine  Park including the Pumicestone Passage was declared in 1982 (updated in 2004  and reviewed in 2009). While Kathleen was not convinced that this status would  fully protect the biodiversity of the Passage, the waterway remains an  important resource for commercial and recreational fisheries as a nursery for  juvenile fish and crustacea, and fulfils a need for escape to wild places in a  growing population.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Kathleen McArthur&rsquo;s book was  instrumental in the inclusion of the Passage and Bribie Island on the  Australian Heritage Council&rsquo;s Register of the National Estate in 1992. Kathleen  was an ever-vigilant watchdog concerning this beloved area, and the need for  vigilance for the future of the Passage and its catchment continues with  population pressure in south-east Queensland.</p>

<h3 class="Heading1">WORRY  ON WOODCHIP THREAT TO PASSAGE</h3>
<p class="TextStandard">Establishment of a $300 million  woodchip industry in Landsborou<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Worry_on_the_woodchip.jpg" width="209" height="330" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />gh Shire would create a Pumicestone Passage  pollution threat, according to conservationist Kathleen McArthur.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs McArthur, who is president of the  Caloundra branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society and an authority on the  Passage, was commenting on Landsborough Shire Council&rsquo;s call on its two State  Parliamentarians&ndash;&ndash;Mr Mike Ahern, Landsborough, and Mr Des Frawley, Caboolture,  to press for the establishment of the industry within Shire boundaries. &lsquo;The  suggestion shocks me,&rsquo; Mrs McArthur said. &lsquo;That type of industry would be  unfortunate for Pumicestone Passage from a pollution viewpoint and out of  character with Caloundra as a tourist area.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Society secretary Mr Stan Tutt called  for an environmental impact study if the Shire&rsquo;s bid was successful. He also  said candidates for the March 31 council poll should state their views on the  proposal before the election. Mr Tutt said residents should also be told:</p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li class="TextStandard">If the industry would take water from residents;</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">What provision would be made to control pollution;</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Where pine supply would be drawn from; and</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Why it is possible to export woodchip when Australians       have been told for years that pine supplies were low and areas were       planted to supply the local market.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;I feel our representatives should not  be blinded by a long string of figures before giving the proposal careful  consideration,&rsquo; Mr Tutt said. &lsquo;The Society realises progress is necessary and  supports planned progress where pollution is controlled. But an environmental  impact study must be made, and its findings made public, before this project  proceeds. This is the most important aspect of the entire plan.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs McArthur said all authorities  recognised that Pumicestone Passage should be retained for recreational  purposes. &lsquo;The 1974&ndash;75 coastal management report said the passage was of  crucial concern,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;This view supports a 1972 report on the Moreton  Bay region.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A woodchip industry in the area,  however, had been in the pipeline for many years. When the government agreed to  increase the size of the national park in the Conondale area it indicated,  though not in so many words, that conservationists would have to accept a woodchip  industry in the future. &lsquo;It looks as if the future has arrived,&rsquo; she said. Mrs  McArthur said the Landsborough Shire Council&rsquo;s suggestion, despite some  advantages it might have, stunned her.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> Leading  Council discussion on the proposal this week, Cr Owen Brown said the  Landsborough Shire was the most suitable area for a woodchip industry. </p>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">FUTURE OF THE PASSAGE</h1>
<p class="TextStandard">The prevailing &lsquo;bigger the better&rsquo; attitude of  developmen<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Future_of_the_passage.jpg" width="300" height="199" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />t could make implications of the conservation alternative to  projected development in the Bribie Island/Pumicestone Passage area difficult  for many people to appreciate, Caloundra&rsquo;s conservationist author Kathleen  McArthur said this week.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs. McArthur was speaking about three alternative  plans contained in a report for future development of that area which was  submitted to State cabinet by the Co-ordinator General&rsquo;s Department this week.  The alternatives are described as the Conservation approach, the Access Centre  approach and the Development approach. In effect these are two extreme plans  suggested as a guide to development by the year 2000, and a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; plan,  namely the Access Centre approach. The report is now released for public  consideration and will be open for public comment until mid February.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;Unfortunately  most people have not accepted the need to limit growth although these ideas  have been discussed for ten years or more,&rsquo; Mrs. McArthur said. &lsquo;These  development plans look forward to the year 2000. You have only to look at what  has been done over the past 20 years to see the value in planning for the next  20.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As  the author of <em>Pumicestone Passage</em>, a  book that brings the Bribie area under focus and which was used as a reference  for the report; as president of the Caloundra branch of the Wildlife  Preservation Society; and as someone who has for many years fought for  preservation of the distinctive character of the island and passage, Mrs  McArthur said she naturally favoured the conservation alternative&ndash;&ndash;but with  qualifications.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Overall she said the interim report was a  well-considered document showing the result of thorough studies of the  environmental, demographic and tourist points of view. She outlined the main  points of all three alternatives, pointing out that all of them disallowed  development on the Bribie Island spit.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The Conservation approach wanted no extension of  Caloundra beyond Bell&rsquo;s Creek, and limitation of population in the Pumicestone  catchment to 10,000. No dredging was to be allowed south of Lamerough Creek,  Golden Beach, and no development at the mouth of Dux Creek. Population of  Donnybrook, Toorbul and Ningi were each to be restricted to populations of 500  and the population of Bribie island to 7000. No canals were to be allowed.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The Access Centre approach again called for no  extension of Caloundra beyond Bell&rsquo;s Creek and limitation of the Pumicestone  catchment population to 18,000. Minimum dredging was to be allowed to keep  waterways clear, and Dux Creek development with artificial bays and islands  permitted. Donnybrook, Toorbul and Ningi were to be developed as Access Centres  with populations of 3000 each. Bribie Island&rsquo;s population was set at 13,000  without the Dux Creek development. No canals were to be allowed, but  modification of the shore front to provide bays and islands was viewed  favourably.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs. McArthur described the Development approach as  &lsquo;open slather for developers with no holds barred&rsquo;. It set a population limit  of 75,000 for Pumicestone Passage and allowed expansion of Caloundra beyond  Bell&rsquo;s Creek with the Pumicestone catchment population limit to 17,000  including 3000 on the canals. The mouth of Dux Creek would be developed for  5000 people including 1500 on canals. Donnybrook would be an Access Centre of  3000 people. Toorbul and Ningi would have 20,000 residents, 3000 of them on  canals, while an Access Centre at the north end of Bribie Island would  accommodate 1500. Mission Point on the island would be another Access Centre  with 1500 people while the south end of the island would accommodate 17,000.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs. McArthur said she was in the process of noting  down her thoughts on the report, which she would later combine in a comment to  the Co-ordinator General&rsquo;s department. These include the following:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;With the Premier&rsquo;s recent proposal for the  electrification of the State&rsquo;s railways, railway towns like Beerwah and  Glasshouse could support a much larger and cheaper living population than has  been suggested. Bikeways and walkways between them and the Passage would  provide useful and healthful means of access to a generation that would  probably suffer extreme fuel shortages.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;There is sufficient foreshore between Bell&rsquo;s and  Currimundi Creeks to allow urban development to go westward, not huddle round  the coast.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;The most important resource of the Pumicestone  Passage is its fisheries. These would be damaged by dredging.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;No canals at all, please. In low-lying areas the  water table is high and a domestic water supply can be drawn off through pumps.  Canal development would interfere with this supply by changing the water table.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;All reports on Bribie Island/Pumicestone Passage have  agreed that it should be retained as a recreation area with limited growth.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;In the text of this report they are suggesting a  deep-water boat harbour for Caloundra. This would mean putting in a bund or  breakwater like any of those artificial harbours. A north-south groyne or wall would  mean sand would build up on one side and starve the other side, the Spit side.  Studies by the engineering department of Queensland University have resulted in  them advising against interference of the Caloundra bar.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;As  regards development in this region, it is worth remembering an instance in 1931  when there was a rise of 3.14 metres in the water level at the pile light for  24 hours due to a drop in barometric pressure before a cyclone. The Golden  Beach area was not settled down then and no-one was affected, but the sea rose  six feet over it. The only parts of Bribie Island not covered at that time were  the sand dunes.&rsquo; </p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>IT&rsquo;S UP TO THE COMMUNITY</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In  Tokyo, in February 1974, an agreement was signed between Japan an<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/It_is_up_to_the_community.jpg" width="250" height="299" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />d Australia  for the protection of migratory birds and their environment, which are  dependent on both countries. It was ratified by the Japanese Parliament in  April of the same year, but ratification by Australia was delayed until  December 1980. This was due to adjustments to State and Commonwealth  legislation, which had to be made in order to ensure full implementation of the  provisions of the agreement. The agreement, now in force, is as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Both  sides will forbid the taking of birds migrating between Australia and Japan and  their eggs and internal distribution of manufactured goods using birds and their  eggs.</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Both  sides will regulate the import and export of birds in danger of extinction as  well as goods manufactured using these birds.</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Both  sides will provide for the exchange of scientific information and data on  migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction.</li>
                      <li class="TextStandard">Both  sides will take appropriate steps for the preservation and betterment of the  habitats of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction.</li>
                    </ol>
<p class="TextStandard">It  is Number 4 that is of the greatest concern to the Sunshine Coast, for it is  the habitat here of migratory species that is constantly harassed&ndash;&ndash;the sand and  mud flats exposed at low tide and the samphire flats used by resting birds  exposed at low tide. Much of this habitat has already been lost in the  construction of canal estates and the dredging and filling of our estuaries.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Australia  is also a signatory to the International Convention of Wetlands of Importance  sponsored by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), for  promoting national and international awareness of the problems of wetlands  conservation. The two major wetlands of the Sunshine Coast would be Pumicestone  Passage and the Noosa River system.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In  the long term, as always, the responsibility for honoring international  agreements and the preservation of our natural heritage is for the community  itself.</p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>MORE  DEVELOPMENTS AT BELLS CREEK</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1997 the Queensland Government set  up a commi<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Bells_creek.jpg" width="300" height="213" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ttee under the auspices of the Co-ordinator General&rsquo;s Department to  examine the question of further urban development adjacent to Pumicestone  Passage.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1979 an interim report was published  and distributed widely as a discussion paper with a request for comments from  all those with an interest in this important topic. Those comments had to be  with the Department by February 15, 1980. Since then, presumably, the committee  has been considering the matter, but no final report has yet been seen.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The interim report contained three  Alternative Approaches in the following categories: 1 Conservation; 2 Access  Points; 3 Development. The first statements in categories 1 and 2 read &lsquo;No  extension of Caloundra beyond Bells Creek&rsquo;. In the Development category, the  first statement reads: &lsquo;Extension of Caloundra beyond Bells Creek with some  canal development&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As the author of <em>Pumicestone Passage&ndash;&ndash;A Living Waterway</em>, which is listed in the  bibliography of the report, I received a copy, studied it carefully and  submitted an opinion on it. A second copy was received by the Wildlife  Preservation Society and similarly responded to.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">With this background participation, it  was most disturbing to read in the <em>Daily</em> of October 1, 1981 that the Landsborough Shire Council has approved a  247-allotment first stage of a proposed 297 hectare land development on  Pumicestone Passage south of Bells Creek, [and that] the &lsquo;original proposal for  the total development had included a futuristic plan with canals&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">So it would seem that in granting this  approval the LSC has pre-empted the findings of a committee that has been set  up by State Cabinet. It seems it has instigated the implementation of the  Development Approach with complete disregard for those people and organisations  who were requested to contribute their knowledge and opinions to the study.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">People so treated will, not  surprisingly, look upon Council&rsquo;s action as not just undemocratic, but uncouth  in the extreme.</p>
