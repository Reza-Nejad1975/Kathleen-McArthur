They protect inland areas from erosion and inundation.</span></p>
                    <p class="Heading1"><span class="TextStandard">As early as 1946 Kathleen McArthur was  protesting about the removal of the King&rsquo;s Beach sandhills, long before beach  protection was of public interest. This was an issue she took up in newspaper  articles over many years. Attitudes she had to contend with were encapsulated  in the words of a woman visitor to Caloundra who remarked that it was a great  improvement not having to get out of the car on a visit to the beach.</span></p>
<p class="TextStandard">Actual and proposed destruction of  frontal dunes for sand mining, roads and housing development along the Kawana  coastal strip became another target for protest by Kathleen and WPSQ in the  1970s. Their concerns were vindicated in February 1972 when not one, but two,  cyclones swept down on the Coast. High seas broke through dunes lowered by  developers along a section of what is now Buddina, flooding the land behind and  necessitating urgent work by bulldozers to construct artificial dunes.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Vital to Kathle<img src="../../../../Photos/Removing_Beach_Dunes.jpg" width="305" height="146" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />en&rsquo;s campaign to prevent  sand mining on the untouched remainder of beach south to Currimundi was her  photographic record of healthy dunes, the effects of severe weather, and  natural recovery. Published in early 1972 as <em>A Living beach</em> by Kathleen and WPSQ Caloundra Branch, complimentary  copies were sent to representatives of state and local government. In the  foreword Kathleen posed this question:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                    <p class="Italic12" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Between Currimundi and Point  Cartwright there are three miles of living beach threatened by processes  everyone now acknowledges to be destructive. Do we, poor in spirit and  apathetic, allow this to happen? Or do we, as responsible stewards of our  heritage, force our Local and State Governments to resume this area and give it  protective management?</span></p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">[On the importance of beach and dune  protection]</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The Sunshine Coast IS because of its  beaches. There are beaches of golden sand, washed clean twice every 24 hours by  the high tides and swept by the winds off the sea. It is our inheritance but we  haven&rsquo;t been very provident with our heritage&ndash;&ndash;we have not only used all the  interest, we have dipped into the capital far too deeply and our investment is  losing its value. It is time we took stock to save what little is left.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">We were never taught to understand the  system by our elders. Our forebears themselves did not understand, they simply  repeated the mistakes made in Europe and America and in Queensland we simply  copied New South Wales and Victoria, the older colonies where the precedent was  set.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Now, faced with the poverty of our  losses, it is time we opened our own minds to the problems, endeavouring to see  it for ourselves, to develop an understanding as a basis for future action, or  maybe lack of action if action is out of order when passivity is required.</p>
                    <p><strong class="ItalicBold14"><em>With the Environment Trendy</em></strong><strong class="Heading1">, September [n.d.], extracts from pp 4,  5, 6, 7</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&hellip;let us look at the early use of  beaches. Until quite recently, practically close up to the end of the 2nd World  War, few people other than commercial fishermen actually resided permanently  along the coastline. From day one the rural population had been involved in  dairying, cropping, grazing and mining.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">One took the family to the beach for a  holiday and the holidaymakers patronised the rare hotel, or the boarding house,  for relaxed swimming, fishing, perhaps a game or two of tennis and much idling.  The majority camped and they camped just where they chose, for the field was  wide open. Some would look down on the rest from the top of the headlands, but  others chose the dunes so they could walk out of their tents straight on to the  tidal beach to swim, or fish, play cricket, or wash the dishes, build sand castles  or gather shells.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Realising the potential revenue, the  LAC [Land Administration Council] or whatever the title was it bore at the  time, surveyed and subdivided and sold foreshore land including that in the  dune system, probably all drawn up in the mapping office where there is no  indication of instability nor any information on the importance of the dune  system to the protection of the tidal beach. Sitting in the survey office they  couldn&rsquo;t see how the Spinifex bound and cooled the sand, nor how the trees  shaded the sand from the hot rays of the sun and allowed them to survive&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&hellip;On Kings Beach there was a barbed-wire  entanglement in case of invasion, which was great protection for the  environment in keeping feet off the dunes, and so, when the war ended, the  dunes had recovered their pristine condition, far better than their condition  at the beginning of the war.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">But it was not long before the rot set  in. 1945, the first Christmas of peacetime brought back the holiday crowds  after five years; five years without luxuries such as beach umbrellas. That was  not seen as a problem; the people simply went into the dunes and broke branches  off the trees to give them shade&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&hellip;In September 1946 I learnt that the  Shire Council was to knock down dunes on Kings Beach to form a level area where  a carnival could be held in the Christmas holidays. Horrified by the idea, I  gathered up the two pre-schoolers and canvassed the Kings Beach residents to  protest, which they did, and the plan was abandoned. Not to be thwarted, the  progressives enticed the Shire Chairman from his farm in the hinterland to the  beach where they persuaded him to support their plan. He did so and the dunes  came down and the carnival went in and it rained right through the holiday  period and it was a miserable failure.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Little by little the dunes came down  until by 1950 there was nothing left. The Lifesavers&rsquo; hut and two houses built  on the foredune had to be removed. Nobody associated the lowering of the dunes  with the loss of the beach. It was not in the Press. It was not in the school  books. It was not heard in Parliament. Most, or at least many, people even  considered it an improvement. Finally, some big seas, without any opposition,  actually reached the road behind. Crisis! Roads cost money, ratepayers&rsquo; money,  but even then it was not acceptable that the dunes were an essential part of  the beach system. Then the very same people began advocating revetment walls.  Education was what was needed&hellip;</p>
                    <p><strong class="ItalicBold14"><em>With the Environment Trendy</em></strong><strong class="Heading1">, September [n.d.], pp 10, 11</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Towards the end of 1971 it was noticed  and remarked upon that work on the dunes in the section that is now named  Buddina had reduced it to almost nothing, at the estimate of those examining  it, 5 feet at the maximum. So the WPSQ wrote to the LC [Landsborough Shire  Council] to ask if the dunes had not been lowered beyond the conditions of the  lease. The engineer was asked to report, but we never did find out what was in  the report, because in February 1972, under the influence of Cyclone Wendy, the  sea broke through the lowered dune.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Wendy was followed immediately  afterwards by Cyclone Daisy and then the highest tides of the year; the erosion  of the whole strand was devastating. The BPA [Beach Protection Authority] much  later revealed some statistics. Wave heights had begun to be measured in August  1968 and in the time from that date to Cyclone Wendy, &lsquo;&hellip;the mean significant  wave height had been 4 feet&rsquo;. During the cyclone of February 1972 there were  occasional wave heights in excess of 30 feet (9 m)&ndash;&ndash;got it! 30 feet!&ndash;&ndash;and  significant heights to 19 feet (5.8 m).</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">On the erosion at Kawana, the BPA  reported:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><em>Major and massive wave erosion of the dunes has resulted in  beach recession estimated to be at least two chains, and erosion scarps varying  in height from 10 to 30 feet.</em></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The <em>Macquarie  Dictionary</em> tells us that an engineer&rsquo;s chain is 100 ft or 30.48 m, so 200  ft or 61 m of beach was lost. (This is presuming that as the officers of the  BPA are engineers they were using that measure, but if they were using the  measure of the surveyor&rsquo;s chain it would have been just over 40 metres.)</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> Yes!  It is shocking! But much more than that has been lost to Kings Beach since the  war, and for that matter, that has been the pattern on all the popular beaches  of Southern Queensland and NSW too</p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>COUNCIL  WILL OPPOSE BEACH MINING LEASE</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Landsborough Shire Council is to object  to an application f<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Sand_mining_lease.jpg" width="225" height="556" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />or a mining lease lodged by Hooker Mining Pty. Ltd. for a  lease of 102 acres just north of Currimundi Creek. This was decided at the  general meeting of the Council on Monday.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The application was for a 10-year lease  to mine for rutile, zircon, tin and gold in an area commencing just north of  Currimundi Lake and extending north for approximately three miles. The  application will be heard in the Gympie Mining Warden&rsquo;s Court tomorrow  (Friday). The Council&rsquo;s decision to object followed the receipt of several  letters. The Mining Warden at Gympie had forwarded a copy of the application.  Letters urging the council to object were included from J. &amp; J. L.  Thomson&ndash;&ndash;in the interest of preserving local beaches. A letter from the  Caloundra Branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society suggested the application  should be investigated fully by the Council and an objection lodged if deemed  necessary. Similar letters were received from E.R. &amp; D.R. Dunning,  Brisbane, which said they had chosen Caloundra as their favourite area and they  didn&rsquo;t want to see it ruined. Mr. and Mrs. Slavioss, who have land at Golden  Beach expressed the same sentiments.</p>
                    <h1 class="Heading1">Must Object</h1>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The Shire Chairman Cr. Jack Beausang  himself moved that Council lodge an objection. &lsquo;We realise the value of  mining&rsquo;s export earnings to the state, but we  have all seen what happens when you interfere with the balance of nature. We as  a Council would be very foolish not to object,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;However, if the  powers greater than we allow the application then we would have to accept it,&rsquo;  he said. &lsquo;There are plenty of other places to mine, rather than this,&rsquo; he said.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cr. Miriam Westaway said, &lsquo;Council  should object strongly to this. Remember what happened to our King&rsquo;s Beach  here. We haven&rsquo;t got over that yet&rsquo;. She said, &lsquo;It was very wrong that the  application was put to the Gympie paper and not in our local papers. We are the  ones most concerned,&rsquo; she said.</p>
                    <h1 class="Heading1">Support</h1>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cr. J. Collie forecast his support for  the mining. &lsquo;This Currimundi area reminds me of a similar area at Kingscliff,  in northern N.S.W.&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Mining has taken place there, but they have  beautified the area, stabilized it and you couldn&rsquo;t wish for anything better,&rsquo;  he said.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cr. Skerman asked if it were true that  back four and a half chains from high water mark would eventually be  subdivided. Cr. Barker interjected: &lsquo;Kawana will have run out of its 7000  blocks before then&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Cr. Beausang: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not concerned with  that. I am concerned with the frontal dunes. If the government allow mining it  should be prepared to finance rehabilitation if the mining company&rsquo;s efforts  fail.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The motion to oppose the application  was carried 12&ndash;2, Crs. J. Collie, Beerwah and Cr. Skerman, Glasshouse,  dissenting.</p>

Circumstances since then force one to the opinion that all this was done simply  to quieten the agitators, after which our elected leaders went back to sleep  again.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Last week the <em>Advertiser</em> published a photograph of the Landsborough Shire  Council&rsquo;s own destructive effort on Kings Beach. The accompanying photograph [<em>Earthmoving equipment active in frontal sand  dunes in a Beach Erosion Control Area</em>] shows what is allowed a few feet  from high water mark on Shelly Beach. The Maroochy Shire Council (its chairman  is on the Beach Protection Authority) is permitting the erection of a large  building on Marcoola Beach, thus showing what a waste of paper the <em>Beach Protection Act</em> really is. And, up  at Noosa, the ratepayers are fighting the Shire in the courts to prevent an  eight-storey building going up even closer to the sea.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Endeavouring to bring these matters  before the Beach Protection Advisory Board, we learned that it had cancelled  its February meeting as there was nothing to put on the agenda.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">This is not good enough. People everywhere  are demonstrating their feelings. A letter from Western Australia last week  told us that conservationists there are planning a march on Parliament. Our own  Government takes no notice of demonstrations unless they are violent. We must  use other methods.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There are enough issues to keep any  number of conservationists busy: the Barrier Reef, Cooloola, and the beaches  predominantly. The preservation of our beaches is an economic as well as a  cultural issue here, for our main industry of tourism depends on the state of  our beaches.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">A statement by Mr. R. J. Benthem, a  world authority on beaches brought to Australia last year by the Australian  Conservation Foundation, included these words of warning:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><span class="Italic12">The Spanish, French, Italian, and the  Greek coasts on the Mediterranean, are almost completely ruined. They have  fallen victim to indiscriminate housing development for tourists, as well as  residents, and every year there is less for the tourists to see. Australia,  too, is beginning to make the mistakes of these countries. I fear that Surfers  Paradise will become like the areas of Hawaii, where sand has to be brought  into popular beaches by ship.</span></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The situation today is this&ndash;&ndash;either we  force our governments into protecting our beaches or we do it ourselves at our  own expense. Which is it to be?</p>

<p class="TextStandard">Our publication <em>A Living Beach</em> is now on sale. The subject beach of this book is  the three-mile section between Currimundi and Point Cartwright under Dredging  Lease Applications No. 136 and No. 137, to be heard in the Gympie Mining  Warden&rsquo;s Court on 19th June, 1972.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Over 3,000 people signed &lsquo;forms of  objection&rsquo; to the mining of this area. Many of these were young people who knew  the beach well and loved it. Others objected on principle although without  first-hand knowledge&ndash;&ndash;the principle that tourist beaches should not be mined.  While many would have wished to visit the area, its very inaccessibility,  except for the hiker, prevented that, for, in truth, it is still a wilderness  beach.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When D.L.A. 135, the forerunner to  D.L.A. 136 (the first application which we opposed was refused by the Mining  Warden on technicalities and the Company immediately re-applied) was first  advertised last September, I found that just when they were wanted urgently, I  had only one black and white photograph of the area, all my others having been  taken further south on the wildflower reserve beach. The delay caused by the  re-application provided time to get together a good collection of pictures with  the beach in a most healthy state&ndash;&ndash;a state in which it will not be seen again  for years, if ever, for unless we meet the challenge before us to save this  last section of our living beach, the future will never see it restored.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><img src="../../../../Photos/Last_Wilderness_Beach_Currumundi.jpg" alt="A Living Beach" width="300" height="345" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />Then came the cyclones and the high  tides and they brought most spectacular erosion, dramatic, dynamic landscape  that so few braved the elements to watch. Waves over 30 ft. high, building up  and crashing down on the shallows, then roaring into the dunes, grabbing tons  of sand at a time and dragging it back to sea! I would not have missed those  ten days despite the fact that I did $55 worth of damage to my camera and lost  two spools of film thereby, containing invaluable data. It was thrilling to be  witness to the force and the fever of the sea gone mad&ndash;&ndash;madly attacking our  land, licking off thousands of dollars worth of sand with one mighty tongue of  water.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In those 10 days, from February 7&ndash;16,  the sea took from us millions of dollars worth of property and we will not get  it back from her without a certain amount of humility. At least enough to  acknowledge that we will be the losers as we have been in the past, if we fail  to respect the role played by the sea and the land and their umpire, the  sand-dune buffer area. Where our beaches have been concerned, we have &lsquo;cut off  our nose to spite our face&rsquo;, as our mothers used to say.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Much of what happened in those ten days  was recorded on black and white film and may be seen in the thirty-six  photographs of <em>A Living Beach</em>, for  this book is entirely restricted to the mining applications area&ndash;&ndash;the last of  our living beaches. It is published for the people of the Sunshine Beach  [Coast] specifically, although its principles of  beach ecology apply more generally.</p>

They have gone to government and Local Authority  representatives, to all district High Schools, to every newspaper circulating  in the area for review, and to other conservation organisations. The remainder  are for sale to the public at the price of one dollar. Enquire at your local  bookshop or newsagent, and if not available, order by post, enclosing one  dollar plus 7c postage, from P O Box 71, Caloundra, 4551.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"><em>A  Living Beach</em> is a first-class publication from the <em>Weekly Advertiser</em> Press, printed in  offset in an edition of 1000 copies. It will never be reprinted and so will  shortly become a valuable collectors&rsquo; piece.</p>
