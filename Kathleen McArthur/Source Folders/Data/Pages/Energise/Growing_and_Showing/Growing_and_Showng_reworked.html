                    <p class="TextStandard">During the early 1960s a WPSQ native  plant nursery at Kathleen McArthur&rsquo;s Caloundra home filled a need for local  species in the absence of commercial or council nurseries. Visitors came to buy  or order plants for gardens, golf courses and footpaths.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Sales became part of a new venture&ndash;&ndash;a  Wildflower Show, with Kathleen&rsquo;s paintings and legally collected local  wildflowers displayed in the &lsquo;Wildflower Room&rsquo; at Midyim. Thousands of  attendees gained an appreciation of the Coast&rsquo;s natural resources. The first  Show was held in August 1967, sowing the seeds of the current Sunshine Coast  Wildflower Festival held each August. WPSQ continues to participate in this  festival with local wildflower walks, especially in the Currimundi (Kathleen  McArthur) Conservation Park.</p>

                    <h1 class="Heading1">QUEENSLAND WILDFLOWERS</h1>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Queensland wildflowers [are] equal in  quality and q<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Queensland_wildflowers.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="480" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />uantity to the wildflowers of Western Australia. The only thing  they lack is good publicity. The road to their publicity is impassable while  two strong barrages remain&ndash;&ndash;Queenslanders are not publicity conscious and  Queenslanders do not acknowledge their floral heritage.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The situation is changing only slowly.  While Queenslanders continue to travel thousands of miles to the West, bringing  back colour slides from Western Australia and the Centre, of species that exist  unseen beside roadsides in their own State an impassable mental barrage will  remain. This fact was impressed on me on my recent visit to Mount Isa where  growing along the roadsides of the district for all to see are flowers featured  prominently in popular Western Australian wildflower books by being given  full-page illustration. And, in the mail on my return home was a dried  arrangement of Ayer&rsquo;s Rock wildflowers, containing, once again these same showy  species. Yet, apart from my host, only one person I met at Mount Isa was aware  of the beautiful flora of their district. What the mind believes does not exist  will not be seen by the eyes, apparently.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Commercial enterprise supports the  existing barriers to enlightenment. The recent Brisbane publication of a  wildflower pocket guide of Queensland flowers, written and illustrated by a  resident of Bundaberg, is titled &lsquo;Wildflowers of the Warm East Coast&rsquo;, almost  as if the publishers were afraid to use the name of Queensland in connection  with wildflowers.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">How to change the minds of a whole  people is material for a propaganda expert with unlimited funds. Meanwhile,  those of us with open minds and eyes that see will have two new treats offered  them this coming wildflower season.</p>
                    <span class="Text12Bold"><strong>Wildflower Show</strong></span>&nbsp;<br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">First, for eight days from 19th to 26th  August, there will be a Wildflower Show at Midyim, Orvieto Terrace, Caloundra,  at which specimens of local wildflowers will be seen mounted and named, with  many available for purchase as garden subjects. For this display Kawana Estate  have kindly given permission to this Society to pick the wildflowers required,  in an area hidden from the roadway so as not to spoil the overall picture in  any degree. This will be the first show of its kind on the Sunshine Coast and  quite possibly the very first showing anywhere of exclusively Queensland  wildflowers.
                    <br/>
                    </span>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Secondly, for those to whom distance  lends enchantment and nothing is so worthwhile as that which is hard to get,  there will be a trip to Brookvale Park, Oakey. The beauties of Brookvale Park  Gardens have been acknowledged by this column before, and it cannot be too  strongly stressed that this work of Lance Cockburn is most impressive, thrilling  to the mind and eye and of great national importance. However, because of a  horticultural advantage of nearly one hundred and fifty years, Western  Australian species have a distinct advantage there at present. Lance is working  hard to collect and grow more of the showier species of Queensland.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Our Society is preparing a guide to the  Wildflower Reserves of the Landsborough Shire and the Shire Council has  co-operated by signposting each one.</p>
                    <span class="Text12Bold">Later Season</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">At present it would appear that the  height of the wildflower season will be later than usual, despite the early  appearance of Hovea, so noticeable at present along our highway. It will be  interesting to note the effect of such an abnormal weather pattern on the &rsquo;67  flowering.

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>WHY  THIS SHOW</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The aim of this show is to single out  the wildflower<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Why_this_show_Wildflower_News_Aug15_1968.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="371" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />s of the Sunshine Coast, with their common names and botanical  names and present them, in living form, in the same room as they are depicted  in water-colour paintings. It is our hope that by doing this, those who view  this show will appreciate them more, and later gain more from seeing them in  their bushland setting.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In the past year, local reservations  for the preservation of wildflower habitat have been considerably increased in  acreage, so that we now know that the people of the future will be able to  enjoy at least a small proportion of our total heritage.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Horticulture is concerned more with the  spectacular, whereas, in the overall pattern of the landscape the small and, so  far as the garden is concerned, insignificant flowers play an equal part in the  character of the whole pattern. For instance <em>Siebera linearifolia</em>, while being one of the smallest of  wildflowers when seen flowering together with <em>Mirbelia reticulata</em> (if these species were more spectacular they  would surely have common names!), may create an unforgettable picture in the  mind of those who stumble on them when crossing a swampy section of our wallum.  They will not be seen by the passengers of a car travelling at 50 mph, as will  Christmas Bells or wallum <em>Boronia</em>.  They would never graduate to the pages of the popular magazines nor is it  likely they would be presented to the public on picture postcards, but they too  are loveable&mdash;they too are worth knowing.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There are flowers peculiar to the rocky  headlands; others such as Beach Stackhousia, Beach Bean, Goatsfoot and Scented  Fan-flower are characteristic of unspoiled beaches and their dunes. The  wildflower plains will present the greatest number of flowers within a given  range, but others may be seen only as the undercover in Eucalyptus forests.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Rainforests add still more, mainly in  the form of climbers such as Bower-of-Beauty, Wonga Vine, Wisteria and  Clematis, which having struggled through the dim light to the sunlit canopy of  the forest, drop their blooms on the track where we walk. There is flowering  everywhere, for without flowering regeneration would cease. Sometimes an eye-glass  or plastic &lsquo;nature viewer&rsquo; may be needed to see, through magnification, the  beauty indiscernible by the human eye.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The world of wildflowers awaits, to  give to us, and be given our love and attention.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">Picture a little cottage surrounded by trees. There is a small terrace  and two glass doors opening into a large green-walled room full to overflowing  with watercolour paintings of wildflowers. For displaying fresh blooms there is  a two sided wooden arrangement with cut-out holes backed by containers of water  for keeping displayed flowers fresh. That was planned as the main attraction,  but was strongly rivalled by the ground outside being covered with forms of  potted plant seedlings.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Our advertising supplement read: &lsquo;A Wildflower Show, combining a sale  of native plants for the garden, 19th&ndash;26th August, 1967, 11 am&ndash;4 pm daily&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">What was not prepared for was the importance of those seedlings. Armed  with the <em>Advertiser</em> supplement with  its printed list of species available, they came bursting in at 8 am. It seemed  that nurseries were not catering sufficiently for native plants, especially for  coastal growing, and having driven all the way from Gladstone or Toowoomba,  Bundaberg or most likely Brisbane, they were not going to be beaten by the  bells, no way!</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It was all very exciting. The days began at first light, bringing in  fresh specimens and it wasn&rsquo;t finished until the last guest/customer might  decide it was too dark to see; he would &lsquo;come back in the morning&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The size of the crowds we brought in was most impressive, especially to  the Chamber of Commerce. Talking down to the instigator of this bonza boutique,  it was explained how it could be done better by presenting it later in the year  when commerce was quiet. So it was carefully explained to this Captain of  Industry that August produced the greatest variety of flower species. He was  not impressed; flowers were considered of the least importance compared with  crowds...</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&hellip;When these shows began in 1967, flowers were everywhere, by the  roadside, on vacant land, on unmown footpaths, especially attractive to the  little ground orchids until the Council began to behave like a busy housewife,  tidying-up everything in sight. A tree had to be shaped, a shrub trimmed, and  the rest mown flat. It was really very funny, but sad to lose old friends like  lady&rsquo;s Tresses and Nodding Greenhoods.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">Once again we present the public with a  showing of their own living<img src="../../../Newspaper Articles/Wildflower_Show69_Wildflower_News_Aug14_1969.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="347" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" /> wildflowers. We do not rape the bush for this, but  with permission, take from it one specimen of each species to display it to  advantage. While a painting may depict the detailed form and colour of a  flower, the flower itself is always more beautiful, being alive. We are not  ambitious or competitive, seeking only to show the wildflowers of the Sunshine  Coast. Have you ever heard of a wildflower show, other than ours, that did not  import showy species from the South and the West? The wildflower enthusiast is  not concerned with size and brilliance, but loves them all for their individual  character.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In 1968 approximately 3,000 visitors  enjoyed the show, for which we make no admission charge. These flowers, after  all, are not ours&ndash;&ndash;they are Queensland&rsquo;s. We want Queenslanders to know them  better and to help us preserve them for future generations. This can be done  only through reservation of sufficiently large tracts of land where all the  local species are present, not just those which lend themselves to gardening.  For instance, our ground orchids have, to date, resisted all attempts at  cultivation, for they are somewhat parasitic on the roots of other plants.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In our <em>Wildflower News</em> of 1967 we published maps of existing wildflower  reserves. Since then, the laying of sewerage pipes has taken a section of No.  1, and No. 2 is in the line of the proposed Caloundra bypass. So, as the late  Romeo Lahey said, the hardest part is not in acquiring a reserve, but in  keeping it. The Currimundi Wildflower Reserve of 112 acres is being subjected  to the pressures of vehicular traffic and illegal camping. We have asked the  Landsborough Shire Council to close it to such use, but without success. The  Council are its trustees. We have, in the past year, asked the Maroochy Shire  Council to reserve a block of wet schlerophyll forest adjoining the Sugar Road,  behind Maroochydore, also without success to date. This is a type of forest  that was never extensive in Queensland, and is now very rare. It has an  under-story of flowering shrubs and is an excellent habitat for many species of  birds.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">While agitating for more land to be  reserved, the Society is also helping to revegetate devastated areas. Over the  years, donations of trees have been made to the Landsborough, Maroochy and  Caboolture Shires for foreshore planting. Another large project of ours is the  planting of the Caloundra Water Supply Reserve (Ring Tank) with koala and  pigeon feed trees. Over six hundred items have been planted there so far and  hundreds more will be put in when they become available from the Forestry  Department Nursery. Due to the very dry conditions following the beginning of  this project in March &rsquo;68, the growth of the seedlings was delayed. However,  they are now putting forth excellent new growth, that is all except the hundred  Cabbage Palms, which may need to be replaced.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard"> Our  proudest achievement is in having influenced so many people to appreciate the  value of, and to plant, native trees and shrubs. After six years of selling  seedlings the rewards are obvious in the larger numbers of birds in our settled  areas. The project is snowballing with the result that from a few hundred, we  are now disposing of approximately 6,000 items per annum. In no way does this  compensate for the overall number of trees and shrubs destroyed by the various  authorities. They all take their cut&ndash;&ndash;the Shire Councils, Main Roads  Department, the P.M.G., and those untouchables, the block builders and the  developers.
