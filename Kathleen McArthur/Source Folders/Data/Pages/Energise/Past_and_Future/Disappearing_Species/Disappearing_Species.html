                    <h3 class="Heading1">OUR  CHRISTMAS BELLS HAVE A PRICE ON THEIR HEADS</h3>
<p class="TextStandard">Are we needlessly destroying the beauty  of our countryside, and the wildlife w<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Christmas_bells_price_on_their_heads.jpg" width="250" height="443" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />hich it has sheltered? Here is a view by  well-known Queensland artist, Kathleen McArthur, writing from her home in  Caloundra&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">CALOUNDRA&ndash;&ndash;Christmas Bells have a price  on their heads in Queensland today. If it were not for this fact, I could  advertise one of the most exciting sights in the country &ndash; acres of wallum  thickly covered with large Christmas Bells. On discovering this wonderful spot  I was so excited and so delighted I wanted to share the treat with all who  might be interested. Experience, however, has taught me that very few people  can be trusted to visit such places and leave with empty hands. This applies to  all wildflowers but particularly to Christmas Bells, which are so readily sold.  Commercially, a visit to such a spot could be worth a small fortune. That it  would be illegal to pick them would not worry anyone for this law is not  policed in Queensland.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">SOME REGULAR VENDORS OF BELLS PICK OVER  CROWN LAND, HAVING A CONVENIENT ARRANGEMENT WITH PRIVATE LAND OWNERS TO COVER  THEM. Such a situation is depressing. These areas of beauty cannot be  advertised as tourist attractions, for advertising would ensure their  destruction.</p>
                    <p><span class="Text12Bold">Ban Sale</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">Continuous picking prevents seeding  while natural mortality and fires soon destroy existing plants. Many areas  close to Caloundra, such as the Dicky Beach wallum, were once covered with  bells where never a bell has appeared for years. Everyone nowadays notices the  absence of bells between the Bruce Highway and Caloundra because they were so  much a feature of this drive in the past. The answer to all this is the  prohibition of the sale of bells altogether, until such time as nursery-men or  florists cultivate them for commercial purposes. It is possible to cultivate  them and doing so would ensure their survival. Meanwhile, as often as I can  spare the hours I escort &lsquo;patriots only&rsquo; to view my find. They can count on  some plants having twelve to thirteen flowered heads and will surely remember  the experience for the rest of their lives. It is unlikely anyone will see such  a sight again in this area for the Christmas Bell areas are doomed in the name  of &lsquo;tourist development&rsquo;. What a paradox!</span></p>
<span class="Text12Bold">Revolt</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">There are elements at work in the  community that are destroying our land, destroying it self-righteously in the  name of progres<img src="../../../../Photos/Blandfordia_grandiflora_Christmas_Bells.jpg" width="216" height="330" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />s. Commercial progress, of course! But a spiritual revolt is  developing among our people. We want the character of our land kept for our  children, and we are beginning to voice our protests against the  ever-increasing destruction. As agitators, we have had our successes and grand  failures (Hayman Island) but there is no stopping us now. The fight is on. As a  veteran combatant, I know the ups and downs involved; the awful feeling of  impotence, when, after apparently successful protestations, some fresh area of  our land is unnecessarily and irrevocably destroyed. (Our shire council set  aside an area as a wildflower reserve, and soon afterwards bulldozed it.) In  the meantime, each one of us can do something.</span>
<h3 class="Text12Bold">Replant<br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">If everyone who owns or rents a plot of  land were to retain, or replant it, with native trees, shrubs, and plants, and  provide a bird bath, we would at least save many of our native birds. The bird  bath and the trees go together, for birds cannot live without water, which  bushland provides naturally. At first there may not be birds around to use the  territory you have created, but they will come, if the flights between areas of  feed are not too great for them. If you keenly want the wild life for yourself,  then persuade others to do it too. You may have to provide them with trees and  help to plant them as well. I know it is worth the trouble. As late as 1947  scrub birds came to our garden in Caloundra. At that time there were trees at  regular intervals between the patches of scrub behind Caloundra and the King&rsquo;s  Beach reserve. There <em>Canthium  coprosmoides</em> (Kooni) and <em>Austromyrtus  dulcis</em> (Midyim) provided plenty of ripe berries, and <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Melaleuca</em> (paperbark) blooms kept stores of nectar. Now, progress having nicely tidied up  the beach and its environs there are but six small, lonely trees growing there  naturally. To record a little progress in the right direction, if somewhat  late, the authorities now are planting this area with native trees. There have  been no birds visiting the area for years.</span></h3>
<p class="TextStandard">Although the birds of the big forest no  longer come near us, the garden is a permanent nesting home for Brown  Honey-eaters (one of the sweetest songsters in our bush) and the Bar-shouldered  Dove. Our visitors include many others, especially migrant birds. Here they  find the foods they have always expected to find here. I feel sure that if all  those people who want to help preserve the true character of our land were to  plant those flowering and berry-fruiting native trees, much could be saved and  some lost ground recovered.</p>
                   <p><span class="Text12Bold">A Corner</span><br/>
                     <span class="TextStandard">Just one corner of a suburban plot,  massed with native flora, water available and free of insecticide could support  a family of native birds. Then, while we are actually doing something practical  to help we can still, and needs must, watch the activities of the authorities  and start screaming the moment they try to sell us out. </span></p>

<p class="TextStandard">The Christmas Bells to the north of  Currimundi Lake are, once again individually and collectively beautiful. It is  one of the few &lsquo;goods&rsquo; that result from fire&ndash;&ndash;you may remember that this area  was burnt out a year ago.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In fact, without fire Christmas Bells  cease flowering. After five years without burning, a <em>Blandfordia</em> patch produces few blooms, and after about ten years,  no flowers at all. The Christmas Bell swamp near the Tewantin&ndash;Noosa Heads  turn-off on the coastal highway had not been fired for about fifteen years and  has not produced Bells for a number of years now. So, newcomers may well be  intrigued by the sign there saying, &lsquo;you must not pick&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Next season it will be a different  picture as the bad fires of Sunday 19th November swept through this land.  However, the Bells there, as I remember them, cannot compare in size and colour  with those around Currimundi. In the area of the Noosa River the smaller orange  coloured Bell often predominates, whereas around Caloundra a flower without its  brilliant crimson streaking is rare indeed.</p>
                    <span class="Text12Bold">At Their Best</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">Anyone wanting to see Bells at their  best will be rewarded by a visit to the Currimundi area in the near future.  They are best to the east of the road about half a mile north of the bridge and  they can be seen clearly from the road.
                    </p>
                    </span>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There was a time when I would not have  dared to mention where to go to see wildflowers with a price on their heads for  fear of the complete destruction of a season&rsquo;s flowering. However, now I think  we are more emancipated and constant propaganda has conditioned us into  realising that there are more ways of enjoying flowers than putting them in  vases; that those w<img src="../../../../Photos/Blandfordia_flamea_Christmas_Bells.jpg" width="220" height="326" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />ho come behind us might like to look too and a few of us  even go so far as to realise that if no flowers are allowed to seed each season  the species will die out completely.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">So go, as many have already done, even  coming up from Brisbane especially&ndash;&ndash;as the Government Botanist did&ndash;&ndash;to see  them, to photograph them and by your presence also police their protection.</p>
                    <span class="Text12Bold">Precious Assets</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">Our Christmas Bell swamps are amongst  our precious assets yet, believe it or not, the only land reserved for them on  the Sunshine Coast is a few acres on the edge of the Currimundi Wildflower  Reserve.
</p>
                    </span>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Tears come up to my eyes, to be  followed quickly by anger when I remember the sight of Bells in flower on what  is now Caloundra Downs, where THE most movingly spectacular sight was created  by the huge area of red and orange flowers, backgrounded by green sedges and  highlighted by the white trunks of tall Paperbarks&ndash;&ndash;GONE FOREVER. We appealed  for their preservation to those who could have saved them, to no avail.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Time is running out. Before next season  the last of our Christmas Bell swamps may have been bulldozed out of existence.  Who cares? Perhaps when the final assessment is made we might prefer them on  film at home.</p>

                    <h3><span class="Heading1"><span class="Heading1">CHRISTMAS BELLS AND KANGAROO</span>S</span></h3>
<p class="TextStandard">For this column this week I wrote an  article of review on our local <img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Christmas_bells_and_kangaroos.jpg" width="250" height="452" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />environment, but it was so depressing it had to  be scrapped. It is hard to write cheerful articles these days on the subject of  our wildlife and landscape. After a prolonged mental reconnaissance, two bright  subjects emerged to be treated in isolation: Christmas Bells and Kangaroos.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">On what is left of the wildflower plain  between Currimundi and Point Cartwright, there may still be seen, and wondered  at, beautiful patches of our red and gold Christmas Bells. They may not be  along the roadside, but by walking back from the road a distance, some will be  found. These are protected wildflowers and not for the picking, despite the  knowledge that the developers will finally destroy them. See them this season,  take your friends and families to see them while there is still time and keep  them as a precious memory or as a record on film.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Amongst the Christmas Bells will be  other wildflowers to discover: the ferny, star-dotted <em>Baeckea</em> and the purple <em>Melaleuca  thymifolia</em>. Little flowers like the Sundews and Bladderworts will be  nestling in the wet patches, and if you flush a bright green parrot, as you  watch it fly low over the vegetation before dropping suddenly, you can tell  yourself that this is a rare bird, the Ground Parrot, and you may never see it  again in Queensland outside two gazetted National Parks. It is an interesting  bird with crepuscular habits and a call quite unlike any other of the parrot  family unless the possibly extinct Night Parrot of the interior, which is its  only relative, and may have a similar call, but is quite unknown.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The home of the Christmas Bells and the  Ground Parrot is going, going fast and this season may be your last chance to  see them both on the Sunshine Coast. They could be preserved on Cooloola, but  after yet another year has passed, our Cooloola National Park is still only a  dream.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">During the year, we local residents can  always take our visitors to see Kangaroos. They are on the Caloundra and  Headland golf courses, but the public would hardly be welcome to wander at will  across the fairways. The spot we use is the grassy verge of the forest behind  the Military Jetty estate at the southern end of Golden Beach. Early morning or  late afternoon grazing kangaroos can be watched there. They are very tame and  can be approached quite closely in a car. This tameness is obviously due to the  fact that the nearby residents value their presence and always take their dogs  out on leads. Remember this! Do not let your dogs free where kangaroos graze.  Still more &lsquo;roos might be seen at the back of the new estate along Bells Creek.  When driving along Golden Beach, please do so slowly and watchfully as  kangaroos cross these roads especially at night. Headlights confuse them so  keep driving lights dimmed. Please help us reserve [sic] what little wildlife  is left.</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading1">THE GROUND PARROT</h3>
<p class="TextStandard">In the past, feature writers have been  reluctant to write abo<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/The_Ground_Parrot.jpg" width="250" height="371" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ut the Ground Parrot for fear of depredations on it by  trappers. However trappers would not have wiped out these birds entirely,  mainly because they are unsuitable as aviary birds, as the developers have done  through the destruction of their habitat for cattle pastures and housing.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">While the vegetation of their habitat  varies throughout the range of the bird between its northern limit on Fraser  Island, down the east coast in suitable pockets, across to Tasmania, extinct  now in South Australia and threatened in its limited Western Australian range  by the same sort of development that we have here, in this district it is the  wildflower plain.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Not so long ago Ground Parrots were  commonly flushed when one went wildflowering on the plain between Currimundi  and Point Cartwright. Now one rarely can show off this famous parrot to  overseas visitors and with the developers&rsquo; mechanical monsters every day eating  further into the habitat, the future is depressing.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Whether the Mooloolah River National  Park (R800) and R892, the Currimundi Reserve, will be sufficient to sustain our  population of these parrots is not known. It is not even known how far they can  fly, eg, if fire swept through R892, could ground parrots fly to R800,  approximately a mile away?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">About five years ago when Professor  Brereton of New England University was doing research on Australian parrots, he  noticed the large eyes of the Ground Parrot, which indicated to him that it was  nocturnal. He mentioned this to Carole Bevege who soon afterwards was in Caloundra  and investigated this suggestion. It was true.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As dusk faded in, the birds began to  call their strangely un-parrot like muted whistle, ascending the scale two,  three or four notes at a time. Then right on dark they stopped calling and  began to fly. One had to crouch low to see the silhouette against the last of  the light in the western sky, for they flew low over the vegetation. After  that, without calls and without light to see, it was impossible to know what  the circumstances were. During the season of July&ndash;August, which we presumed was  their breeding time, the evening calling was strong, repeated to a lesser  extent at dawn and occasionally short calls were heard during the day.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The Ground Parrot is a seed eater, so  it may possibly prove to be adaptable to grassed pastures if these were not  grazed before seeding as Charles Barret in his book <em>Parrots of Australasia</em> wrote: &lsquo;Although epacris and grass-tree  covered country&hellip;are its favourite haunts, I have seen it equally at home in  paddocks thickly covered with Scotch thistle&rsquo;. The only other parrot that in  any way resembles the Ground Parrot is the Night Parrot of desert country in  the centre of Australia, and it could be extinct for it has not been reliably  reported for over half a century.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">As fire on the wallum plains is  necessary at intervals to ensure the maximum floristics, so too is it probably  equally important to the bird that has evolved with it. The vegetation has to  be open enough for the bird to walk between the plants.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">When all that is  left are the few reserves, management based on biological knowledge will be  absolutely necessary.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">[On the Ground Parrot at Kawana]</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Back in 1974, three young friends and  myself decided we should study the nocturnal Ground Parrot [<em>Pezoporus wallicus</em>] across the wallum  between Currimundi and Point Cartwright&ndash;&ndash;the present Kawana. We stopped halfway  up the track to include as many birds as possible and one of us was ready with  the tape recorder; we didn&rsquo;t have to wait for dark as we discovered that the  bird is crepuscular and begins his activities at dusk. It would rise from the  vegetation, about a metre high, and fly just above it so we had to crouch down  to view it against the last light in the sky; all the while it was calling  full-throatedly its rising bell-like notes. It was one happening, the birds  calling right across the length and breadth of the plain. It was thrilling! The  next day the news was passed to Professor Brereton at New England University  who flew up in his little plane to share the experience with us, as he was  studying parrots at the time.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">There are no  ground parrots there now.</p>
