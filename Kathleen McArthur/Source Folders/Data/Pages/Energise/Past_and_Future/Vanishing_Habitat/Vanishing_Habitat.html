<p class="TextStandard">Kathleen chose to describe them in a  way that would inform future generations of their beauty and diversity, for she  considered them threatened and vulnerable. Today some of the area remains, but  no longer as it was.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Similarly the magnificent wallum plains  across Kawana have mostly disappeared, despite much work to protect them.  Encroachment of housing and industry has watered down the viability of bushland  reserves along Tooway Creek. In Watson Park at Shelly Beach, regeneration of  original species clearfelled by an earlier council has since occurred,  following WPSQ and community pressure on council to develop an informed  management plan.</p>

                    <h2 class="Heading1">THE VANISHING DUNES</h2>
<p class="TextStandard">By Kathleen McArthur</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">We have no more than eighty miles of  unprotected beach in Queensland. It lies between Double Island Point and the  border. To the north of it is Frazer (sic) Isla<img src="../../../../Photos/Vanishing_dunes_sketch.jpg" alt="Vanishing Dunes" width="350" height="108" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />nd and beyond that the Barrier  Reef, which gives a measure of protection to most of the State&rsquo;s coastline. Of  this limited extent, the only stretch of mainland beach not either spoiled or  threatened is from Noosa Bar to Double Island Point.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The most popular beaches have long  since lost their sand dunes and all the others are threatened by &lsquo;development&rsquo;.  No local authority or government has yet seen fit to take measures to preserve  beach dunes. Rather are they inclined to bulldoze them out of existence for the  purpose of making roads, parking areas or building sites. Shire councillors and  members of parliament do not accept responsibility for the destruction of these  useful natural features. If any damage is ever admitted, it is put down to  erosion from cyclonic conditions.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Beach dunes have evolved as natural  buffers between the land and the force of the sea. They provide the upward  sweep needed to exhaust the waves and create the upsurge of wind that will rise  above the vegetation. Certainly they block the view of the beach from behind,  and tourists apparently cannot be expected to descend from their coaches and  cars when bulldozers can so easily push the dunes down. So our seascapes are  spoiled in the holy name of trade. We have condoned it. Will posterity excuse  us?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Time and circumstance have delayed for  several years the despoiling of that stretch of beach between Currimundi and  Point Cartwright, so let us go there and see it as our descendants might see  it, were we wiser.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Here ar<img src="../../../../Photos/Pigface_sketch.jpg" alt="Carpobrotus aequilaterus - Pigface" width="300" height="167" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />e five to six miles of beach,  almost straight, with several small outcrops of rock to break the monotony of  line and add interest for the wanderer. To walk from Currimundi to Point  Cartwright and back while the tide is low means there can be little dallying to  explore. To walk on the beach when the tide is high can be hard going, so it is  recommended that a whole day be devoted to it. The northern third is steeply  shelving beach of heavy, gritty sand that is tiring at any tide. The surf there  is dangerous and to be avoided.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Point Cartwright gives its visitors a  pleasant picnic spot with 360 degrees of good viewing, from Moreton Bay to the  Glasshouses in the south, to Noosa beyond Mount Coolum in the north, Buderim  backed by the Blackall Range in the west and the Pacific with its ships to the  east. The only scar on the landscape is a nearby area of bulldozed sand that is  bleak, shifty and near lifeless.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is the southern end, both in the  dunes, behind them in the heathland and on the wildflower plain that the  greatest interest lies. The plain provides a variety of wildflowers all the  year round, with a glorious display in August and September. In November,  December and January the Christmas Bells bloom there, though only in  exceptional seasons are they in such numbers as to be thrilling to see. There  grow <em>Dampiera stricta</em> in abundance  and of a blue so deep it is royal. In the summer season are green and purple  Hyacinth Orchids, those saprophytes defying cultivation. The visitor may find  himself alone amongst the flowers, but must not think he can safely take a  bunch of blooms from the area. Thousands of visitors each year see this display  and the only legal way to take wildflowers from the area is in the camera. Take  wildflowers in your camera and you will have them forever.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is hoped by those who value this  area for its wildlife that one day it will be declared a sanctuary.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">One reason for this corner being such  good wildflower country i<em><img src="../../../../Photos/Spinifex_Sketch.jpg" alt="Beach Spinifex, Graceful Sheoak and Goatsfoot" width="300" height="631" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" /></em>s its protection by the dunes from prevailing winds.  When the lake breaks out and flows to the sea, the sand-spit may be washed away  but soft black rock prevents its cutting into the dunes beyond a certain point.  The first dry season will close up the entrance once more.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">One can study the dunes from the tide&rsquo;s  limit to the plain beyond. First are the long runners of Beach Spinifex (<em>Spinifex hirsutus</em>) and Goatsfoot (<em>Ipomoea pes-caprae</em>). The work of these  two species is of the highest importance. They hold the sand together in their  roots and catch the drifting sand in their leaves. In early summer the  roly-poly seeds of the Beach Spinifex are blown about, sometimes into the water  to be washed up in other areas and sometimes higher into the dunes to take root  and run, as a new generation, to the sea, thus replacing the parent plants. It  is in such places the little Dotterel will lay her eggs without any  nest-making. So watch your step there! If the parent bird is seen doing the  broken-wing act or trying to lead you away, you will have warning. Be watchful  anyway, for the parents may be off hunting.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Higher up, the Sheoaks grow. These  graceful, waving shade-giving trees (<em>Casuarina  equisetifolia</em>) are the predominant feature of the dunes. Apart from the <em>Pandanus </em>(also called Native Breadfruit  or Screw Palm), which prefers the headlands, the Sheoaks are the first line of  defence against the wind. Theirs is a passive resistance. They curb the  strength of the wind, letting it seep through with constant sighing. There is  no other tree to take its place on these unprotected shores. When such places  are being replanted, it should be the first to go in. With its sparse foliage  of grey-green needles it does not block the view; it enhances it.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Flitting through the Sheoaks are the  Mistletoe birds, those handsome little creatures of red and blue-black. There  too, is the Rainbow bird whose nest is at the end of a tunnel in the sand, the  Brown Honeyeater, too, and up and down from grass to trees, ever on the move  and twittering are the Fairy Wrens. In this area there are two Fairy Wrens, the  Red-backed and Variegated. I cannot help but think they sometimes cross-breed,  for I have seen, on two separate occasions, years apart, the blue species with  a red saddle. They are not very shy birds and when picnicking on the dunes  their curiosity will draw them close.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Behind the shelter of the Sheoaks are  the Banksias (<em>Banksia integrifolia</em>),  which, when in bloom, seem to attract more birds than any other trees on the  coast. One moment they will be filled with busily silent Greenies and Bluies  (Scaly-breasted Lorikeets and Rainbow Lorikeets), which will move out as a  flock with deafening screeches. All the many different Honeyeaters of the area  will take their fill of nectar. Possibly the most beautiful of these is the  little Scarl<img src="../../../../Photos/Carpobrotus_glaucescens_Pigface.jpg" alt="Carpobrotus glaucescens - Pigface.jpg" width="291" height="289" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />et Honeyeater.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Down the leeward slopes of the dunes grow  those trees and shrubs which can stand all the harsh and poor conditions of  drift sand, except the wind. There, Kooni (<em>Canthium  coprosmoides</em>), either as a scrub or small tree will display its small,  white, star-shaped flowers or its berries in various colours, so loved by the  Mistletoe bird. There is Tuckeroo (<em>Cupania  sp.),</em> and Frazer Island Apple (<em>Acronychia  imperforata</em>). Nearing the bottom of the slopes are Paperbarks (<em>Melaleuca leucadendron</em>), and Red Ash (<em>Alphitonia excelsa</em>) joining with all the  others from above in a tightly-packed community. Before spreading out on to the  plain are the Old Man Banksias (<em>Banksia  serrata</em>) and Wattles (<em>Acacia  cunninghamii</em>). All this growth provides the happiest hunting ground for  birds of many kinds.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The most surprising aspect of the  dunes, composed as they are of only drift sand and a limited amount of humus,  is the ground cover of wildflowers. The Goatsfoot has large mauve  convolvulus-like flowers, mostly in summer. The deep-pink Pigface (<em>Carpobrotus aequilaterus</em>) has flow<em><img src="../../../../Photos/Stackhousia_spathulata_Beach_Stackhousia.jpg" alt="Stackhousia spathulata_Beach Stackhousia" width="284" height="424" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" /></em>ers on  it all year through, not opening out well on cold days. Beach Stackhousia (<em>Stackhousia spathulata</em>), with its earthy  scent, begins to flower in Spring. There is Sweet Wattle (<em>Acacia suaveolens</em>) and the humble pink Emilies (<em>Emilia sonchifolia</em>) in winter, while all  through the year may be seen those two flowers, the colours of which so nicely  complement each other, the bright yellow Twining Guinea-flower (<em>Hibbertia scandens</em>) and the blue Scented  Fan-flower (<em>Scaevola suaveolens</em>). The  Fan-flower makes a wonderful showing in the spring months. Yellow Wood Sorrel (<em>Oxalis corniculata</em>), pink Beach Bean (<em>Canavalia rosea</em>), and the blue Dianella  add interest. One of the best-known flowers on the beach is the Evening  Primrose (<em>Oenothera drummondii</em>),  because it has the height of its season in midsummer holiday time. This is an  introduced plant.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The keen-eyes will find many more  flowers and birds than are mentioned here. While scanning the ground for  flowers do not neglect to look up to see that magnificent bird, the White  Breasted Sea Eagle. There is a pair of them in the area. The sky-gazer may also  see the Whistling Kite and the Red-backed Sea Eagle, while sea and shore birds  provide yet another field of observation.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is possible to be lucky enough to see  a Wallaby and a Spiny Anteater.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Are we not very stupid to allow this  wonderland of wildlife to be replaced by what is, as yet, quite unnecessary  sub-division?</p>

<p class="TextStandard">Everywhere I go this springtime, people  stop me to s<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Kawana_Is_wildflowers.jpg" width="250" height="223" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />ay, &lsquo;Have you seen the wildflowers along the Mooloolaba road?&rsquo; (or  the &lsquo;Caloundra Road&rsquo;, depending on where the speaker lives). Suddenly, everyone  is aware of them. A wonderland has been provided free. There is excitement and  surprise.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Twelve years ago I tried to have that  wildflower area reserved as a National Park but was informed it was too  valuable for development. Yes, I have seen them this year as I have seen them  every year. The only difference being that before the road was put through,  they were safe from vandals who pick and dig them up for transplanting into  their gardens.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Queensland has a great wealth of wildflowers  both in landscape display and in the variety and interest of the species, but  in the past there has been little interest shown in them. While tourists every  year flock to Western Australia on highly organised tours, they have not  bothered to walk a few miles to recognise the great wealth of flora at home.  Nothing has been done through the media of education and publicity to inform  the Queensland public about its wildflowers.</p>
                    <span class="Text12Bold">Changed View</span><br/>
                    <span class="TextStandard">The opening of this road seems to be  changing the view that wildflowers are exclusive to the west. It is rather late  in our history for this change of heart. The whole of that area, except a small  reserve in the south-east corner, will lose its wildflowers as the plans for  its development involve the digging of canals and the use of the spoil in  raising the level of building sites. This will completely change the habitat,  undoubtedly destroying these plants which require the highly specialised  conditions of the wallum swampland. It is to be hoped that before the change  occurs, every single, man, woman and child of us will make some effort to look  at the beauty of this landscape and look at each individual flower and  remember. Yes, let us remember that we, the members of our generation are  responsible for the destruction of a truly remarkable section of our national  heritage.

                    </span>
                    <p class="TextStandard">The question of the future will be &lsquo;Had  we the right?&rsquo; and the answer will certainly be &lsquo;No!&rsquo; In perpetrating this  wickedness we sin against ourselves, our children and our Creator.</p>

                    <p class="Heading1"><strong>WHAT  ARE THE COUNCIL&rsquo;S INTENTIONS?</strong></p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">On page 47 of the <em>Sunshine Coast Advertiser</em> o<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/What_are_the_councils_intentions.jpg" width="250" height="308" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />f 30th October 1974 the Landsborough  Shire Council advertised a proposed amendment to the Town Planning Scheme for  part of the Shire of Landsborough, by &lsquo;excluding from Parks and Recreation zone  thereof, land containing 1 hectare 6,1874 [sic] square metres, described as  Subs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Section 11A of Resub. 2 of Sub B of Portion 13A, Parish  of Bribie, County of Canning, fronting Russell Street, Caloundra, and by  including such land in the &lsquo;Residential&ndash;Medium Density&rsquo; zone of the said  Planning Scheme&rsquo;. Objections in writing may be lodged before December 4th,  1974.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Presumably the Shire Council intends  selling this land, which at the present time forms approximately half of George  Watson Park. Understandably the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland is  opposed to any reduction of parkland acreage, of which there is already an  inadequate amount. It would never condone such an act.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">However, if it is the intention of the  Council to use the purchase money thus obtained for the purpose of resuming and  paying compensation for the 5-acre Sub. A below this park, which has been the  subject of much discussion and correspondence over the past twelve years and  which extends to &lsquo;high-water-mark&rsquo; and is quite unsuitably zoned &lsquo;Caravan  Park&rsquo;, we would reconsider our objection.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">If this should be the intention of the  Council it would seem they are either under-valuing Subs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 or they  are planning to make money on the deal for other uses. To that we object.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">We therefore call upon the Landsborough  Shire Council to publicly state its intentions with respect to this rezoning,  and to do so leaving sufficient time to those members of the public who are  interested to lodge objections.</p>

                    <h3 class="Heading1">SAD  STORY OF &lsquo;DUNNYCAN PARK&rsquo;</h3>
<p class="TextStandard">The story o<img src="../../../../Newspaper Articles/Sad_story_of_Dunnycan_Park.jpg" width="250" height="470" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" />f Watson Park, Caloundra was  &lsquo;a sad one that needs to be retold&rsquo;, said the Secretary of the Caloundra Branch  of the Wildlife Preservation Society (Mrs. Kathleen McArthur) this week.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">She said the park had been transformed  &lsquo;from a lovely timbered reserve where wildflowers abounded, to a brick and  concrete jungle in 11 short years&rsquo;. &lsquo;It is disgusting Local Government,&rsquo; she  said. &lsquo;We would be better off with an administrator with good taste.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs. McArthur was registering her  objection to a proposal by the Landsborough Shire Council to rezone part of the  western section of the park from &lsquo;parks and recreation&rsquo; to &lsquo;residential&ndash;&ndash;medium  density&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;The Parish map of 1951 shows this area  as R. 655 and this is repeated on the 1965 map,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Now we are told by  Cr. R.G. Bell that it is Council freehold (<em>Advertiser</em> 20.11.74). When was the status of this land changed from &lsquo;reserve&rsquo; to  &lsquo;freehold&rsquo;? Or was it ever changed?</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Mrs. McArthur said one of the first actions of the Caloundra Branch of  the Wildlife Preservation Society after its inauguration in 1963 was to request  the Council to allow the Society to manage the area for the greater enjoyment  of people. &lsquo;All the Society wanted was to remove a few dead trees. In reply it  was told that the &pound;400 needed was not available,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Shortly afterwards  the reserve was clear-felled, stacked, burnt, ploughed and harrowed&ndash;&ndash;using  peanuts for finance presumably.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;That was not all. Trees were planted  in neat rows with ample space for the roaring southerlies to hinder their growth  and for mowing to prevent any untidy regeneration. These trees had been  advanced in disused dunny-cans which were then left in tidy rows beside the  trees: hence, with fun for all, the park being dubbed &lsquo;Dunnycan Park&rsquo;.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&lsquo;Now  we are told it is not much of a park and would be improved by medium-density  housing,&rsquo; Mrs. McArthur said. </p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">From the pandanus on the rocky  headlands to the Beech trees on the Mooloolah River, which is the Aboriginal  &lsquo;Caloundra&rsquo;, the vegetation is extremely diverse. There is the tropical dune  flora of soughing Sheoaks, silver Spinifex grass, runners of Goatsfoot and  Beach Bean helping the Spinifex to bind the sand and throwing their flowers  around to attract attention to their good works. There are Banksias large and  small, quietly coloured or glowing golden. There is the wallum heath and its  commercially valuable honey flow and its grand colour display of winter and  spring and its flaming Christmas Bells in summer. There are white-trunked gum  trees and the summer flowering bloodwoods, gullies of maiden hair and  rainforest trees, swamps of yellow hibiscus in bloom all the year under  Paperbarks or Cabbage-trees. Waterholes wear scented blue Waterlilies with a  miniature sun at their centres. Mangrove foreshores teach a lesson that not  everyone will learn. Scribbly gums, Tallow-woods, Blue gums and Grey gums, Box  and Turpentine mark the path all the way out to the Mooloolah River&rsquo;s  rainforest verges, where there are still a few Beech trees after which the  Aborigines named the area, and where Lilly-pillys drop their bright pink fruit  on to the quiet waterholes&hellip;</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">&hellip;Caloundra is not backward in the sense  of being behind other seaside resorts; quite the opposite is the truth.  Caloundra, perhaps more than any other seaside resort has cultivated its  indigenous flora. To give the point an Irish flavour&ndash;&ndash;we<img src="../../../../Photos/Pandanus_Sketch_Wildlife_June.jpg" alt="A well know Pandanus near Currimundi Creek" width="300" height="204" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="left" /> are backward in not  being much further forward. To be in keeping with our residents, we should be.  Twenty years ago, Banksias, Sheoaks and Pandanus were not planted, and just ten  years ago there would not have been a chance of Paperbarks being planted in  public places. With such environmental progress there is hope that in time the  eroded estuarine foreshores will be reconstituted through the planting of  Mangroves, an idea that at the present time is regarded as undesirably radical.  Along with Banksias, Sheoaks, Pandanus and Paperbarks, Mangroves will be  accepted in time.</p>

                    <p class="TextStandard">18 August, back at Caloundra:</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">Caloundra at present provides a most  interesting study of the effects of drought conditions on wild-flowers.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">In principle, the same applies to all  the vegetation. Going first to Too<img src="../../../../Photos/Sowerbaea_juncea_Vanilla_Lily.jpg" alt="Sowerbaea juncea Vanilla Lily" width="247" height="349" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" align="right" />way Creek flats I was greeted by the  continuous and loud humming of bees that were busily gathering a rich store. My  eyes at once gathered in these riches, the bounty and the beauty. There were  the Bush Peas, some yellow with red centres, others plain yellow. There were  masses and masses of these to which the bees were paying particular attention.  Slightly paler in colour among the peas, were bushes of <em>Phyllota</em>, and paler still the Wedge Pea and in amongst all this  yellow were the white <em>Pimelea</em> and  Devil&rsquo;s Rice, the mauve Vanilla Lilies and red Boronia and many others. Almost  everything seemed to be flowering and the sight of it all was gay, refreshing  and soul-stirring. Not a breath of drought! This is a comparatively small area,  perhaps less than ten acres and is almost surrounded by trees, rising ground  and a row of homes. The dry westerlies barely stir it.</p>
                    <p class="TextStandard">It is very different out on the wallum  flats between Dicky Beach and Currimundi. Although a ridge to the west must  afford these flats a degree of protection, the area is so large the wind is  able to gather speed as it crosses over it. Flowering there is almost  non-existent, even such toughies as the ground orchids, which conserve their  own moisture in tubers, are hard to find, and when found are in very poor  condition. Pink <em>Caladenias</em>, our  Pinkies, which were countless before we went away, have gone; Stewart&rsquo;s Foxes  too. There are but a few miserable White Doubletails, only half normal size.  Vanilla Lilies, with their everlasting flower-heads, are hanging on partly  dehydrated stems&ndash;&ndash;simply dying of thirst. It makes one sad and thoughtful.</p>
